Reviewed in India on 24 May 2023,"Guys, this is my 4th HP product and I see that nowadays HP products are very bad in quality. Having trouble in left click button, simply double clicks mostly for a single click and taking a snap with this mouse is a nightmare. Have to try atleast 3 times to capture the correct frame. Its been like this for 2 weeks, bought it on 25 Sep 2022. Should get a replacement and that's another headache, called a local HP authorised service centre the said we can do only with ticket number from HP customer care team, so called the toll free number they said no need ticket numbers for mouse.
