Awesome product that i have been using since 2016,5.0 out of 5 stars,R Myers,I've been using the product since 2016 in all my outdoor lawn equipment including my outboard motor.  while it still smells like a 2 cycle engine at the end of the day I am no where close to smelling as bad as the old oil.  I also know for a fact that plugs are cleaner and last longer.  Great product and worth the extra cost to me.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2023",,
Great for Pre-Mixing your Mazda RX8,5.0 out of 5 stars,21days,"I've been using this product for over a decade to premix my Mazda RX-8.  I am sure it will work just as fine in other Mazda rotaries.  Before this brand I used the Royal Purple full synthetic premix...until it got insanely expensive LOL.  No noticeable difference between the two brands.  The Lucas premix works well and it is way cheaper...which is important if you put a lot of miles on your rotary engine car or use a high premix ratio due to racing.  For regular street use I tend use 1/5 ounce/gallon, or 1 ounce/gallon for spirited driving.","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",,

Good for picky 2-cycle engines like Stihl,5.0 out of 5 stars,DASA,"So I have been using this in my machines for the last 5 months.  I used to use whatever was on sale because my Echo machines run like Toyotas and don't really care what you put in them, as long as it's mixed properly with pure gas.  I bought a little Stihl BG50 blower to see what all the fuss was about and right away noticed the little Stihl was soiling it's pretty white/orange bodywork with a constant spray of sooty oily exhaust using the cheap mix I feed the Echos.  I was worry about some of the bad reviews here about the Lucas product damaging engines but I can attest after many gallons of mixed fuel burned in the Stihl that the Lucas fixed the oily mess.  No more oily exhaust, thank you Lucas Oil.  PS:  I use the same stuff in the Echos, they run great on it too.  I should note I am in a very warm environment, I have no experience using this in cold climates.","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2021",,
