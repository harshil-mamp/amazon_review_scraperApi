Only the best.,5.0 out of 5 stars,jroberge,People always wonder how I keep my 2006 crown Victoria running for so long. It’s all in the quality of oil that you use. I wouldn’t put anything else in my car. I change my oil around every 7000 miles.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",,
286.000 miles,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dutchboy,"I have been using this oil in my 2005 Chrysler since I bought it new and she is still going strong 18 years later and 286.000 miles.
I change the oil about every 7000 miles and use a good WIX filter.","Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2023",,
Six quart case cheaper than 5 quart jug and one quart.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,"Needed six quarts for a Ford 4.6, and buying six quart case is cheaper than buying five quart jug and one quart.  Quart bottles bought one at a time are expensive.","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023",,
Mobil1 is the best full synthetic for the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bryce,"I've used Mobil 1 for a while now, at least in my past two or three cars.  Good stuff, I usually still switch it out somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 miles.  The stuff that comes out usually seems in pretty good condition usually and my fathers' even used the old oil in a '80-'90's Toyota Camry and it ran perfectly fine with it.
You can usually find this stuff pretty cheap on here or at a Walmart.  For the love of god, DO NOT buy it from a car place like Advance Auto or Autozone, they'll try to charge you 40-50 dollars per 5qt jug.  I bought two packs of the 6qt box when it was on sale a while back for my new Challenger (the 5.7L Hemi takes 7qts of oil...).  The box looked like it had oil on it, but none of the bottles inside were leaking, so i guess it dripped down from another box.
The attached picture isn't the best, but it shows a bit of how it was packaged.  I was worried they were just going to ship them directly leaving the branded ""Mobil 1"" boxes on my doorstep for people to take, but it came inside of a plain box.","Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2017",,
It’s Mobil1!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Frank,"I dunno what to say about Mobil1. Oil is weird and people who care about oil are wierd. I’ve used this stuff in every thing that benefits from oil and it has never failed me. Cars, suvs, lawnmowers, guns,  hinges, bearings, mechanical keyboard switches mixed with some grease. If it needs lube I use Mobil1. The oil cans have a nice big cap which makes them easy to pour and easy to refill with old oil to take to your recycle center. It’s been the oil of the future since I was young and continues to be the oil of the future today","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2020",,
What more can I say than this is the best motor oil you can use for a '03 Honda ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shane M.,"What more can I say than this is the best motor oil you can use for a '03 Honda Civic. I've only just recently switched over from my local mechanic's crude to this. Within the last 10,000 miles I've noticed a significant difference. With the use of a premium oil filter (BOSCH 3323) and this motor oil I subjectively can feel the difference. Also, my motor oil is no longer as dark as soon. I'm almost 3,000 miles into my last oil change and I feel like I've got plenty of detergent life left. Normally at 3,000 miles my oil would be obsidian black, now it's barely even as dark as 3rd press olive oil.
This along with a quality filter have had me see the light! I'll only be using Mobil 1 from now on in any of my vehicles along with a premium oil filter.","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2014",,

Best Synthetic Motor Oil Hands Down,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eric,"I've been using Mobil One off and on since 2007 when a co-worker first told me about it. I have a 2002 Accord V6 sedan that is now pushing 156,000 miles in just 8 years! Using this oil, in conjunction with Fram's high mileage oil filter (for cars with over 75k in miles) helps to ensure it keeps running smoothely.
I typically go to one of those Chevron run Oil Changers here in the SF Bay Area (if you're not here, I'm sure you have an equivalent chain where they change the oil for you and you have the option of bringing in your own card products).
Mobil One is simply the best and I've yet to experience any problems related to the type of oil I put in my Honda.
PS: If you're an Amazon Prime member like me, it really makes shopping for oil online easy (or from Amazon in general)!","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2010",,

"09 Camry SE, 4cyl, 303k miles & running like new",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wes,"All I can say is Mobile 1 is the only oil I use.  I started with 0W-20 synthetic for the first 100k and then switched to 5w-20 and have been using it ever since.  I do a lot of driving (300k+ mileage) and my car runs like new.  That's not to say I do not perform other types of engine treatment (liqui moly, steam cleaning, mopar & wd-40).  If you want your engine to last forever, use this oil.","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2017",,
