The best oil out there,5.0 out of 5 stars,Controlled Chaos,"This is epic oil, really. It improves gas mileage overall and withstands extremely demanding environments.
In changing it it always is cleaner than most and still has the characteristics of good oil unlike others which appear thined out or like sludge.
I trust it because after using GTX for years on vehicles hitting 300,000 miles, that says it all.
Great stuff, get it.","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023",,
