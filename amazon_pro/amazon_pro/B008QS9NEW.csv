"its Oil, OEM Oil, High Priced Dyno OEM Oil",4.0 out of 5 stars,Empiror22,"There are some people that will fight about which is the right or proper oil for your car, truck, boat, or motorcycle. The best oil for a motor is any new oil or full oil, meaning do change often and ensure that it is at proper level. After that it is best practice to use the correct oil for your motor, there are many labels/ certifications for each motor manufacturer. Some oil brands will pay to have those on their box or jug, some will not. with that said, this oil is fine and will work in many motorcycles that have WET Clutches. I have tested various brands of oil and this one seems to be a very generic Motorcycle oil, there is nothing special about it except the Yamaha name.
Pros:
1. its a MC oil
2. it has Yamaha as its brand
Cons:
1. Cost make it similar to brands Synthetic (full or semi (blended) oils)
2. you can find the Yamaha Full synthetic (same 10w-40) on other sites for the same price (or within $2)
3. Additive package is very much average (high Calcium and low Magnesium for cleaners, and (low MolyB (makes sense in a WET Clutch), average Zinc, and Phosphorus for anti-wear)
Overall, I only used this oil during Break-in of a new bike, already have Yamaha Full Synthetic in there now and have a different brand that will be used during next oil change.
Check out Castrol 4T, Amsoil Metric MC Oil, or Shell Rotella (5w-40 or 15w-40).
The shell rotellas (used in other motors and MCs of mine) have similar additive packages (and are half the price).  But as always use the oil that best suits you, your budget, riding style, and most importantly Motor.","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023",,

Didn’t read description,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nate LaPerriere,"I thought I was buying two stroke motor oil for my mx600 and mx700 snow machines, but somehow bought this oil. I’ll use it cause I have a Yamaha outboard so didn’t see a reason to return it, but I can’t believe I didn’t see this was for a four stroke.
I never used it in my snow machine cause it showed up after the season had already come to a close.","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023",,

Why bother with anything else?,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kevin Bennett,"I have used in all 3 of my bikes with zero issues. They all run strong and have smooth clutch action. Also it’s the oil the manual calls out. Price is reasonable. So I ask…..what else do I want? If you have a Yamaha, you can’t go wrong with this oil. So I ask, why risk using anything else?","Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2023",,
