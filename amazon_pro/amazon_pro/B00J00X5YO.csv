This is great quality engine oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,John,"Mobile one motor all is one of the top engine oils on the market you just never want to run an engine more than 5000 miles without changing the oil regardless if it says 20,000 miles without changing annoyed because I don't get dirty and dirty oil causes friction in the motor, dirty pistons, and eventually scarring on the piston cylinders.  If you're reading this review, please change your oil every 5000 miles the engine will love you for it and will last you a whole lot longer. I have a Chevy 2002 and I've been running this motor oil in my engine for the past 21 years never had a problem because I always change my motor oil every 5000 miles.","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2023",,
Only oil for Mercedes-Benz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jacqueline Lystrup,"I buy two of these 5 quart jugs for every oil change I do in my Mercedes-Benz AMG's.  Each one takes 9 quarts per oil change and this is easily the least expensive way to get that quantity.  I have an E63S AMG as well as an ML63 and this oil I will ever use.  I have seen some 5 quart oil advertised that appears to be the same thing but it came in a bag inside the box instead of giving you a plastic jug.  This will be a 5qt jug which is far better for giving you an empty jug to fill with a cap to take to your nearest oil recycling place after your oil change is finished.  Make sure never to mix synthetic oil with standard though.  If you have a BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Porsche, etc that's a European make, this is definitely the oil you're looking for.","Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023",,
If it's good enough for Ferrari it's good enough for mama's Toyota!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Westerns Forever,"'Been using AMSOIL for over 40 years.. Mobil 1 was never a full synthetic.. But that's changed.. Times have changed..  Engines these days run for hundreds of thousands of miles.. Synthetic oils have been a large contributor to this longevity.. Amsoil's always been hard to find.. Amazon sells Mobil 1, which is now a Full Synthetic.. And I'm old and on a fixed income.. Mobil 1 wins!","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023",,
Over 360000 miles,5.0 out of 5 stars,William Eddy ll,I started using Mobile 1 extended on my then new 2011 chevy impala on its first oil change and I use a fram10000 mile oil filter. I add half a quart is all to my car at 5000 miles other cars may need more between oil changes. Then I change the oil and filter every 10000 miles. I now have 365000 miles on my original factory engine with no oil burning either! Mobil 1 fully synthetic oil is a great product!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2023",,
Mobil 1 Extended Performance High Mileage Full Synthetic Motor Oil 5W-30,4.0 out of 5 stars,steve,"only gave 4 stars as I have never used this one -
I have been using Mobile One Full Synthetic for my cars and trucks

Noticed this one (Extended Performance) and thought why not check it out
Is it just be a relabel of the standard High Mileage bottle ?? don't know
Either way, I have always been happy with Mobile One products","Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2023",,
Good oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Derrick,"Good oil,  always recommend Mobil 1, I have seen ProjectFarm and FordTechMakuloco on youtube about Mobile 1 and it is a superior product.  I use in all my vehicles including my rarely driven hauler truck which I only change 1-2 times a year.  I also use this product in my newer F150 which asks for 10k intervals, I drive this truck 1500-1800miles/mon and I change every 5k but knowing that I'm changing it ""mid life"" or going over a bit, gives me peace of mind.  I use it in my wife 2020 vehicle which is used very lightly and changed every 10k.  It fits all my vehicle needs.","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2023",,
Actually good for 20K plus miles,5.0 out of 5 stars,Luis Martinez,"First used this at 160K miles on my Lexus GX 460. Changed it at 180K and the oil was still full and color was somewhat clear. Couldâ€™ve probably done another 5K with oil, but for sure good for 20K at least.","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023",,
Truly Epic Oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Controlled Chaos,"This is epic oil, really. It improves gas mileage overall and withstands extremely demanding environments.
In changing it it always is cleaner than most and still has the characteristics of good oil unlike others which appear thined out or like sludge.
I trust it because after using GTX for years on vehicles hitting 300,000 miles, that says it all.
Great stuff, get it.","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023",,
Perfect for Mercedes GLC43 AMG,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bolts&Banter,"DIY guy here doing maintenance on my 2018 Mercedes GLC43 AMG. This ships fast and the pricing is competitive, saving me a trip to the store.","Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023",,
I use it often,5.0 out of 5 stars,Family Man,My higher mileage vehicles actually all vehicles use synthetic as of 6 years ago. I take excellent care of them and feel confident in mobile one. I feel the higher mileage additives help engines run better for the long haul. Recently I noticed the price in subscribe and save are priced fair. Every 5000 miles oil and filter. I recycle the old oil and it's accepted at local auto parts store.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2023",,
