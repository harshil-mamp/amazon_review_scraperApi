Excellent mix oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cupcake,"I don't own Stihl stock, so this review has no bias.  This is an excellent 2 stroke mix oil that seems to better stabilize fuel and preventing fuel deterioration over time, smokes very little during device use and seems to burn clean enough to where spark plug fouling from burning oil is very reduced.  My equipment runs well and has good longevity using this oil. Excellent mix oil.","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2023",,
