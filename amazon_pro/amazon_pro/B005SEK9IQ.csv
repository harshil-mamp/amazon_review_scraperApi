The GOAT.,5.0 out of 5 stars,marc torres,"I will never buy another brand of Motor Oil other than Royal Purple.
I have 2019 Lexus es350 Fsport and decided to change the type of oil I had been using which was oem Lexus/Toyota Motor oil, which is actually Mobil. Its suggested to go to a high mileage oil at 80K miles so I went with Royal Purple. Even though this grade is not available for specific High mileage which is oem spec sae ow20. So I decided to spend the extra $ on this oil along with the K&N oil filter. I read a review that this oil improved their cars performance at the 2nd oil change. Well I made the change at 80K miles  and drove to FL from NY which was over a thousand miles each way.
And on the way back to NY after  and just over 2K miles of driving, My cars performance has been outstanding
 More importantly,.consistently performing better. And now I have gotten the 2nd oil change with this Royal Purple and will never buy another Motor Oil other than This one. I really didn't expect to feel a difference in performance due to a specific Motor Oil. But Royal Purple has proven otherwise. And the reason for the high miles on my csr is cause Im an Uber driver in NY and will be an Uber driver in Miami. This product performed to all the hype.","Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2023",,

Worth every cent,5.0 out of 5 stars,Casey Berwald,"Switched over to purple after 100k after giving in to people who swear by it. Cleaned it up and really made a difference, engine ran smoother and quieter and by the 2nd oil change with purple it was a whole new car. Its the only oil we use now in all our cars and equipment.","Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2023",,
