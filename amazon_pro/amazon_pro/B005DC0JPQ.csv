I will never use any other two-stroke oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dan Miller,"A dealer told me about a training event that he went to for Stihl. Essentially , he told me about a demonstration they did to show off this new synthetic oil. They took two new string trimmers out of the box, one was filled with a regular two-stroke oil the other with this synthetic made by Stihl. Day zip tied the triggers down and let them race until they were out of gas. This was done on camera so that people didn't have to be in the room with two string trimmers. Running for a half an hour. Next, they filled each trimmer with straight gas, no oil. Predictably, the one with standard oil seized up within a few minutes and was ruined. Amazingly, the one with synthetic oil was able to run through the entire tank. Tank. That's how well this lubricates your equipment. If you're going to spend $800 on a string trimmer or a leaf blower or anything that requires two stroke oil, in my opinion, you'd be crazy not to buy the best oil on the market. This is straight synthetic, you will notice a difference  And be protected","Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023",,

2 gallons at a time,5.0 out of 5 stars,Matt V,I like to use teh Stihl recommneded 2 cycle oil.  Over the long run I feel like i get great repeat perfomance from my Stihl equipment.  The 2 gallon size (makes 2 gallons) is more conenient than messing with the smaller 1 gallon size.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2022",,
Overpriced but I trust it.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Steve,  the man...",After you factor in the tax on this oil you’ll discover you’re adding $3.50 PER GALLON to your gas price.  If your gas is selling for $4 that means your 2-stroke gas is now $7.50 per gallon and and even more if you’re adding a fuel stabilizer.  When’s the madness end?  Is this the industry’s way of making us convert to electric?,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2022",,
