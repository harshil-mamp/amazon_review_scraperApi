No comparison,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,"Best oil period. You pay for it, but it is worth it. I have used this in my Yamaha 97 40hp since day 1. I also have a 2001 Merc 9.9 that says only use ""Mercury approved oil"" and I run Yamalune in that with no problems. Smokes alot less that anything else I have tried. Yamaha was at the top of the 2 stroke outboard performance charts before 4strokes took over and this is what powered them.
Spend the money, protect your motor and have it for a lifetime.","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2020",,

Low smoke compared to non oem brands!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rusty,"Gone through jugs of this all season on my 86 200hp Yamaha outboard...tried the Quicksilver brand bc I was in a time crunch.
