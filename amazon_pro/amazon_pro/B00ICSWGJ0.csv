had surprising results using this oil.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bigjap3,"I have a 2006 Honda Pilot. Love this car. Well had some problem with the engine (the place that serviced it did not replace the oil and the engine blew long story) they replaced the engine and dont know what oil they put in. The engine started leaking and smoking after I got it back. They did not replace the seals and gaskets would should be done by any competent mechanic before putting in a used engine. So i drove the car around making sure the oil was topped off and the smoke did dissipate after about a week but i would always smell burning oil after driving the car. Time came for an oil change and i decided to do it myself looked on amazon and this had a good rating. changed the oil (first time in my life i had done it myself, make fun of me if you want). well being paranoid i put down a piece of cardboard and went out to check every once in a while hoping that i did it right and no oil was leaking from my work. Well i did it right and drove the car. Well when i drove the car to work (i commute 180 miles daily) I did not smell the oil burning. looked under car and where the oil was leaking before (rear main seal, oil pan gasket area) NO LEAKS! Now I was skeptical it was the oil but looked online and their is evidence a good synthetic for high mileage cars can restore the seals and possibly gaskets depending on the make of the car. I am more than happy. and this oil is at a decent price compared to walmart or auto zone ect. So I would highly recommend this for your vehicle, I wont say it will do what it did to mine but it is worth a try.","Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2017",,

Great oil for my 2008 Civic!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Earthling1984,"I usually use Mobile 1.  I still use Mobile 1 in my Toyota Fj Cruiser.  But, I bought my Civic used about 3 years ago.  Bought it with around 120k miles.  Now have 150k.  I have used this oil since I got the vehicle (nicely kept and maintenanced one owner vehicle before me).  Vehicle was just fine when I got it.  No leaks or issues (other than a starter motor that failed in the first 6 months, but, that is a wear and tear item that has nothing to do with the engine or oil).  I have never used a high mileage oil before (never owned a vehicle with over 100k before).  I hope this keeps my Civic going to 250k+ miles!  So far so good.  3 years and not a single issue.  Engine smooth as butter.  The last year or so, during covid, I didn't drive as much.  But, I usually do oil changes once a year, or, 7.5k miles; whichever comes first.  I bring my oil and filter to my local mechanic I have worked with for 10 years, and, he just charges me $15 labor.  He said the oil always comes out still looking almost like new.","Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2021",,
Sucess with Castrol,5.0 out of 5 stars,GCP,"I have been using synthetic oil since my days endurance racing motor cycles. Our team including three riders would race at high speeds for as much as 24 hours without stops, except for fluids and change of riders. After each race we would tear down the bike including engine and transmission to replace worn or damaged parts. We were approached by a sales rep and asked if we would try synthetic oil. He offered to pay for any parts or damage to the bike. Heck, it meant free parts so we tried the product. After seeing the difference in the condition of the engine after two different races we were sold.
Ever since the 1970's I have used synthetic oil in all my vehicles. To date I have never had an engine repair of any kind. I also use synthetic transmission fluid. When Castrol started providing synthetic I started with their product and have never had any problems of any kind. I have owned at least a dozen cars and driven some of them over 120,000 miles without engine or transmission problems.
I believe that the triangular shape of the oil particles in Castrol keeps more of the oil on the cylinders when the engine is turned off and therefore provides instant lubrication when you first start your engine. When an engine first starts is when most of the wear occurs in an otherwise well lubricated engine. I start my vehicles on synthetic the first time I change the oil. I drove over 5000 miles on one vacation riding a motorcycle across the country into Canada and back and never changed the oil until after the trip. I rode every day of that trip. I never had an engine problem with that bike in the six plus years I owned it, two before the trip and four after. If you have used non synthetic oil in a vehicle for more than 10,000 miles I would not suggest changing to synthetic since it could clean out all the sludge in your cylinders and require new rings etc. I am not a mechanic or an expert on engines, but that is my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2013",,

Best oil I have ever put in my car.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jeffrey Smith,"Once upon a time, my car (which I inherited at 120,000 miles) had a significant amount of piston slap during a cold start.  After it warmed up, it would go away.  I figured it would be an interesting experiment to switch to synthetic oil to see what the hype was about and if it really made a difference in engine longevity, especially now that my engine was ""getting on in its days"".
I got some of this Castrol 5w30 full synthetic purely because BMW and Triumph motorcycles use it as their factory fill.  Maybe Castrol pays them to be the factory fill, but hey, if the engineers are happy with it, I'm sure it'll be okay.
After the first cold start, I immediately noticed that the piston slap would go away by the end of the driveway, rather than most of the way to my destination.  I figured that was a good thing.  Oil is slipperier when cold, does a better job lubricating when cold, engine has less wear on cold starts.  Brilliant.
One day, my friend told me that ""all synthetics are the same"" so long as they pass the same API certifications, etc. and you should just buy the cheapest one at the time.  I found some oil from a company that starts with ""valv"" and ends with an ""e"", and it was the cheapest, so I got that.  Piston slap came back.  Mind you, it wasn't as bad as when I was using dinosaur oil, but it was definitely worse again.
After a very short 3,000 miles, I switched back to this Castrol synthetic, and the engine doesn't slap at all when cold, the valves are quieter, it's just generally happy!  This Castrol oil seems to like to ""stick"" to surfaces in the engine, so that even after a weekend sitting in the driveway, come a cold Monday morning, the oil will still be on the metal surfaces to lubricate it even during initial startup.
I'll definitely be buying Castrol for a very long time.","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2018",,
Good Quality Oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Felix,"I give it a five star because it’s engine oil and it works in my car, but my five-star rating doesn’t mean I’m an engine oil expert or that this oil is better than any other oil brand. I have previously been told that the best engine oil brand is ANSOIL, which if going by its price, it must be a superior oil. As I was told, ANSOIL doesn’t have any wax substances, which, supposedly, can be problematic for some engines.
Anyways, I purchased this oil for four main reasons; it’s synthetic and superior to most petroleum-based oil. I can get it a lower price here at Amazon than on any other local store. It arrives at my home free of shipping charges…well somewhat free since I must pay for my Prime subscription…I guess nothing is really free. But the main reason is because I had changed the oil on my 2013 Mazda CX9 a few weeks before and then realized I had used the wrong oil specifications.
The 2013 Mazda CX9 calls for 5W-20 oil and I had used 10W-20 instead. Must mechanics I consulted with said it wasn’t a big deal, while online forums were not cleared about the subject. I didn’t think it was going to cause problems either but wasn’t completely sure. So, I reasoned, it’s my car, I’ve been taking good care of it and it looks and run like new. So, I had to decide on whether to spend another $24.67 and have a piece of mind or not replaced the oil and ran into many sleepless nights wondering if not changing the oil was the right choice. So, I replaced it, I’m short of $24.67, but having piece of mind is priceless.
By the way, I’ve been using Castrol oil on my cars, for the most part, since I purchased a new 1986 Dodge Daytona…it was a nice looking car, but poorly made.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2018",,

All I can say is WOW,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jay,"Just put this in my 2013 Chevy Avalanche along with a purolator boss oil filter. She has 123,000 miles on her. I bought her last spring with 119,000. Wow is all I can say. I have never heard or felt such a difference in a motor from an oil change. Much quieter, and smoother. Very smooth, actually. Even makes my exhaust note sound better with less drone in the cabin from a flow master 40. I’ve only did my test drive and a leak check and so far so good. The oil pressure is now steady at about 39-40 at idle whereas before it would drop to about 30 at idle. My manual calls for a synthetic blend but I opted to go full synthetic. I thought about mobile 1 high mileage synthetic but upon further research, I found that mobile one is better for new engines and keeping them running and looking new. After reading up on castrol, I decided to go ahead and go with it because I read that it helped older engines run better. TRUTH. it does and it did. The oil that was in my truck was pretty dirty. I don’t even know if the dealer I bought it from actually changed the oil or just reset the oil life and slapped a sticker on the windshield. It looked like it wasn’t changed. Shame on me for not doing it when I got it. That’s on me. I’ll probably change it again at around 3000 instead of waiting the 6000 due to how dirty it was.  I’ll let this change clean her out a little and I’ll do a fresh change with this Castrol high mileage synthetic once more. So far so good. I’m very happy with my choice.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2021",,
This is a great product and I am not paid for this review,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,"I have bought this product before. My 2010 F150 has 125k miles on it. When I was running Motorcraft, and other oils in my truck did not do very well mileage wise. I was getting about 12 to 13 combined. I put the Castrol oil in and I am back up to 17 to 18 miles per gallon combined. When on the highway I was getting about 20 miles per gallon. I have 5.4 liter Triton engine and that is pretty good for that engine with 20 in tires. It was also loaded up with luggage, and emergency equipment for what ever might happen while traveling. I am a veteran and a boy scout. Be prepared and you can't use it if you don't have it with you. Any way with the price of gasoline, and the price of everything climbing faster than income now days. You do what you can to protect your ride. I am not willing to pay for the price of a decent truck at these indecent prices. Also it helps to keep a higher quality oil filter in use! The Paper one are good for 3000 miles or less, and I would go with less with a paper filter, while the others are good for at least 5k or more.","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2022",,
Excellent,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pitty,"Possibly the best Group 3 “full synthetic” on the market. I would put penzoil ultra platinum and mobile 2 annual in the same boat. The thing is until now M1 was the only one to offer annual oil and it’s finally cheaper at $36 a jug. This Edge Extended is the same offer for $25!!! That is Nutz!
Should you use this oil for a full year.. Maybe.. should you use it for 20k miles.. I would not do that. Even if you are mostly highway like me I still only push it to 13k miles. That is plenty safe for this oil as long as you use a M1 annual filter with it or an equivalent. I tack on 26k miles per year so I only need to do a change in spring and fall. That’s $50 per year for oil. Not to bad!! Especially when you factor in it is some of the best oil money can buy.
Your best best is to use this edge extended and PP ultra. Both are easily 2 of the best oils made. Whenever one is cheaper get that. PP ultra can be had for $24 at times. Same for this edge extended. That is an incredibly good deal for the quality of oil. These 2 oils protect your engine so incredibly well. PP Ultra takes PP natural gas synthetic oil which is borderline superior to all other group 3 oils and adds high performance additive packages. Edge ext is probably the best group 3 oil on the market and it does contain some group 4 PA0s. The reason more people use 0w-40 now even on 5w-30 cars is because it is just thin enough to still work in those cars and since it is a 0w it contains more group 4 PAOs in order to meet that 0w rating. With that u get a super high quality oil and most in that viscosity are priced great in the US due to lower demand.","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2019",,

"Oil consumption up, not down",5.0 out of 5 stars,Trix,"2011 Terrain with 2.4 Engine (105K) SUV loves oil! Bought in early 2020. Didn’t do enough research. That’s on me. Selling dealer says it’s between VIN numbers for recall. So I’ve tried various brands/flavors.
AC Delco went about 700 miles /qt. (Dealer oil change). Brand V Syn went 1000 miles. A couple flavors of M1 went 1200 miles.
Then I tried Castrol Edge 5w-30 in Black 5qt jug- I couldn’t believe oil could make this big a difference! No clatter at startup; very little valve train noise running. (Other reviewers commented on this too). And 2000 mi/ qt!! And no more ‘brown grunge’ under filler lid.

Update:
With such good success with Edge Advanced Full synthetic, I thought I’d try the High Mileage version. Just like another reviewer, my oil consumption went up.

Castrol Edge High Mileage is an excellent product!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ron,"I am an avid ""do it yourselfer"" with different vehicle types all requiring different types of oil. I do my research! Castrol Edge High Mileage engine oil is an excellent choice This is what you need to know about Castrol Edge High Mileage Automotive Engine Oil:
• Castrol Edge High Mileage engine oil meets or exceeds the current API rating of SN Plus. The year your vehicle was manufactured typically dictates which API rating it requires... very important! API rating SN & SN Plus is currently the most recent rating... as of the writing of this review.
• Castrol Edge High Mileage engine oil
is a Full Synthetic product. This means you are buying the absolute best technology currently available for protection against viscosity breakdown. This too is very important. It means this oil will retain its weight or thickness throughout its functional life. So if for some reason your oil change has been delayed, it isnt slowly becoming thin (like water) while it is being operated in an extended use phase! Great insurance!
• Castrol Edge High Mileage engine oil is especially formulated to protect against Thermal Breakdown. Todays engines are designed to run hotter than past engine designs. Thermal breakdown protection means that the oil can operate in a broader temperature range without changing form from high temperatures. There are many driving conditions which can cause higher temperature levels in your lubrication system. It is very important to be safe guarded against this threat.
• Castrol Edge High Mileage is a leader in how much additives are included in their oil that is above and beyond the requirements of the advertised API rating. The amounts of additives in terms of parts per million (ppm), are important for versatility. You can safely choose this product to protect in a wider range of engine types and services if you are unsure of the rating recommended.
• Castrol Edge High Mileage engine oil has an excellent detergent factor. This means it is literally cleaning your engine while it is lubricating. Very important! Your oil will then carry this dirt (carbon) back to the filter and deposit it there.
So you see, all these factors make Castrol Edge High Mileage engine oil is an excellent choice to help you manage the proper protection against wear & tear in your high mileage vehicle.","Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2020",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tiBb6j6KL._SY88.jpg,

Helps Reduce Carbon Buildup on the Valves and Reduces Sludge Formation,5.0 out of 5 stars,Geek On The Hill,"
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 I've delayed reviewing this oil because it takes months or more to be able to say anything worth saying about a motor oil. What I can say about this one is that it definitely reduces carbon buildup on the intake valves of my car's GDI engine.
What it all comes down to in a nutshell is that GDI engines don't get the fuel wash effect of gasoline passing over the intake valves like carbureted and port fuel-injected engines do. That means that the hydrocarbon vapors coming from the PCV systems form deposits on the intake valves that never get washed off.
Oils like this one are engineered to be less volatile at operating temperatures, which reduces the vapors coming through the PCV system.
One of the ways I know this oil is producing less vapor is that the oil level hasn't budged since the last time I checked it. I never considered my car to be an ""oil burner;"" but this time around, after two oil changes using this oil (with induction system cleanings before each oil change), there's no measurable loss at all.
No loss of oil in the crankcase means little or no loss to vapor in the PCV system, which in turn means little or no buildup on the valves.
If your car has a GDI or T/GDI engine, therefore, I can recommend this oil as a good choice. There are others, of course; but this is the one we're talking about now, and it's a good one.
Richard
EDIT: I'm updating this review with borescope video of the head under the valve cover. What I was looking for sludge to decide if it was time for a flush after 50K miles. No flush needed. In fact, I was pretty amazed at how clean it was under there.
So not only does this oil reduce carbon in the induction system, but it has excellent detergency as well.","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2020",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512spFJ6jQL._SY88.jpg,

Looking past the marketing jargon,5.0 out of 5 stars,P. Seow,"I tried to make an informed purchase by looking at the different oil manufacture websites for a breakdown of what's in their products. However, all I got were buzzwords like ""High Performance"", ""SynPower"", ""Full Synthetic"", and for this product, ""Edge with Syntec Powered Technology"" And when I find their product data sheet, they labeled their additives as ""proprietary."" This kind of secrecy reminded me of how food companies used the word ""spices"" in their ingredient list.
Then I read reviews from other car owners and all I got were anecdotal experiences, such as ""my car is performing better"" or ""It's amazing. I believe 100% in this product!""
Despite the lack of concrete information, I went ahead and purchased this product, and then I paid an oil analysis laboratory to get some hard facts. Not surprisingly, ""Syntec"" is no where to be found in the oil. To save you some Googling, I included a brief explanation in the additives break-down below (units are in ppm and the values in parentheses are universal averages for 5W-20 oils):
Calcium [detergent/anti-corrosion]: 668 (1903)
Magnesium [detergent/anti-corrosion]: 1413 (71)
Phosphorus [anti-wear]: 705 (647)
Zinc [anti-wear]: 818 (756)
Molybdenum [anti-wear]: 72 (73)
Boron [anti-wear]: 65 (82)
The most interesting thing about Castrol Edge with Syntec is the reliance on magnesium as the main detergent/anti-corrosion agent. This is typically seen in oils designed for diesel vehicles. The other interesting thing to note is the above average zinc count. Zinc is known to degrade catalytic converter performance, and since I live in California, this is a problematic issue due to the state's strict emission regulations.
The other important characteristic of engine oils is Total Base Number (TBN). This value indicates the amount of anti-corrosion (acid neutralizers) additives are in the oil. It is an important indicator of the service life of the oil. The TBN for my unused oil sample is 10.7, which is above average. It is important to note that TBN does not decline at a constant rate, and the rate of decline is different for each oil type and rating, as well as driving habits and conditions. With this is mind, I went ahead and performed an used engine oil analysis at 8,510 miles and the sample came back with a TBN of 4.0. Oil change is usually recommended when the value is 3 or less. The lab recommended that I can shoot for an oil change at 10,500 miles. I'll post an analysis of that oil change when the car reaches that threshold.
Last, but not least, is the physical characteristics of the oil. And this is where the synthetic nature of this oil gives it an advantage over conventional oils. Synthetic oils maintain their viscosity ratings longer and more consistently than conventional oils. My unused oil measured 8.50 centistokes (cSt) at 100°C and it was reduced to 8.41 cSt after 8,510 miles. Both values were well within the viscosity rating of 20.
In conclusion, based on the oil analysis and the performance of my engine with this oil, I give Castrol Edge with Syntec 4 stars. It will get another star if my next oil change at around 10,500 miles shows good results. I hope my review provided you some of the data you need to make an informed purchase. Please remember that my review is based on two samples and a lot more are needed to make a conclusive observation.
**Update: 7/30/2014**
The lab result for the oil change done at 10,500 miles shows really good results. In fact, the TBN is higher (at 5.5) Because of this, it is recommended that I can shoot for an oil change at 12,000 miles.

Clean after a year,5.0 out of 5 stars,G-wiz,"It's been a year since I put this in my 2003 VW Passat W8 and I looked at last week and it's just as clean as the day I put it in, (very very close). It's actually clearer now than other oils are brand new. It was a bargain last year. I guess it was on sale. I don't know how to predict those. I will say that if you bring your own oil and filter, the cost to change your oil is very pleasant. You've paid in advance, so it's still expensive to have a car. It's just great that you can know the quality of what's going in your car.  The clarity may have been partly due to the Bosch oil filter. It's specs are much better than other brands. install and you know the filter is the best. Bosch cabin filters are awesome too. I'd recommend buying oil filters and cabin filters in quantity so you don't have to go to the trouble of buying them. Just get the oil. (Does oil store well? I began to doubt that. So I'm not recommending that.) I am here to buy it again, so I'd recommend doing these things too. If you take your car to an oil change place, be sure you pick out quality oil, oil filter and cabin filter beforehand, and bring them when you go. It's your assurance that your doing the best you can for your car, and not just leaving it up to the Quicky Change place's choices for their benefit. And yes, of course it's great to see that the oil change will be so cheap by comparison to buying their oil at the same time. It may be me tricking myself by spreading out the costs, call it what you will. It's still nice to know everything is my choosing and the oil change charge will be cheap, since you're bringing your own stuff. It's like a reward for taking the time and trouble to shop for what you think is best. You might change your mind later. Who knows? I liked this oil and I liked the Bosch filters I bought too.  This oil seems like it's smoother at high RPM, over 6,000. That's where I noticed the engine sounding like it's ""taking it easy"". Before, I really avoided driving in that range, but it feels more comfortable. That's got to be a good sign for the oil. In fact, when you stomp on the gas, the car overreacts and downshifts twice, which lowers the power to the wheels. Best to just ease it up quickly, no stomp. But I was testing the car and noticed that it no longer slows the car when doing this. It's just the beginning of a more normal acceleration. That's better oil.  Anyway, your performance may vary but I don't think you can go wrong with this oil. It's the best stuff I've ever had in any of the cars I've owned. That says a lot.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2021",,

Anyway, I went ahead and put the oil in the vehicle.","Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2019",,
"okay oil, great price",4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon_Shopper619,"I've switched over both of my '05 Toyota Tacoma and Volvo XC90 high mileage vehicles to this oil, after previously only using traditional oil.
I have not seen any difference in performance between this full synthetic oil and traditional oil.  This oil was quite dirty after its first change however. I have not noticed any seal leaks. So far its okay.
The price on Amazon is similar to in-store at Wal-Mart. Much cheaper than the auto parts stores, although some will price match. However, the brick-and-mortar stores never seem to have this item in stock.","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2018",,

Fair Price for a Good Product,4.0 out of 5 stars,RW,"Fair price for a good product.  At the time I ordered it, it was a good price.  Shortly after it arrived, Walmart lowered their price to $1.50 less.  Not a big deal and I'm still satisfied.
The only knock I will give on this order is that I ordered 3 jugs and they arrived loose in a large box.  The box arrived barely holding together.  It was torn and had holes punctured in the side.  One jug was barely in the box.  I was quite surprised none of the jugs sprung a leak.  I'm satisfied and when it's time to reorder, I will certainly consider Amazon again.
As a side note, I see some discussions about how long an oil is good for; or extended oil changes; or better protection.  Take anything you read on the internet with a big grain of salt because if your engine fails, those comments mean nothing to the repair shop.  Having said that, my truck oil change interval is 6 months/5,000 miles.  That recommendation is with regular motor oil.  Now that my vehicle is out of warranty, my choice when using synthetic is to go at least 8,000 but no more than 10,000 miles.  I have friends that go 12K to 15K miles on their oil.  We all stay on top of our maintenance, do periodic oil sample analysis, and log a lot of freeway miles.

Another expense when owning a BMW,3.0 out of 5 stars,Red Ball Jets,"Newer BMW's require A3/B4 rated oil not because it's ""better"" (as BWM owners would lead you to believe) but because this formulation is less likely to damage the sensors within the exhaust system.

After buying a considerable amount of this oil, I sold the BMW and am now using it in my RAM 1500 until I exhaust the supply.

That tells me that the oil is doing i's thing and is protecting the engine during those critical restarts (where a huge portion of the wear takes place).  As with most other synthetics these days, it is a bit pricey until you see that it will last for over 3X the old-school oil change thinking of 3K.  So in the long
