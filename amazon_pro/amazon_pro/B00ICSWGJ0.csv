The best oil in overall.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wan Liem Lie,"Have been using Castrol brand for over 20 years with 4 kinds of its oil choices.

Great motor oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,CJM,"I have been using Castrol motor oil products for over 30 years in all of the vehicles that I have owned. I always get at least 200,000 miles out of every car that I buy so I think that the Castrol motor oil is a big part of that success. I would highly recommend Castrol motor oil to anyone who wants to keep their car for a long time and have it run well.","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023",,
Very good engine oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,qqzj,"This engine oil is as good as Mobil 1 or Pennzoil. I use it less often than the other two because they have more promotions. But right now, Aug 2023, Castro does have promotions that purchase of 10 quarts will get a $20 gift card. So I got 2. Very good deal. Very good oil.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2023",,

Best thing to make your vehicle last are regular oil changes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Evan,I'm particular about what I put in my car and don't trust those quick change places to do the job (too many horror stories).  This particular oil is difficult to find in box stores in the weight I need (5W-30) and the high mileage version is impossible to find outside of a parts store where oil is severely marked up.  So Amazon it is for oil and filter.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2023",,
