This is great quality engine oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,John,"Mobile one motor all is one of the top engine oils on the market you just never want to run an engine more than 5000 miles without changing the oil regardless if it says 20,000 miles without changing annoyed because I don't get dirty and dirty oil causes friction in the motor, dirty pistons, and eventually scarring on the piston cylinders.  If you're reading this review, please change your oil every 5000 miles the engine will love you for it and will last you a whole lot longer. I have a Chevy 2002 and I've been running this motor oil in my engine for the past 21 years never had a problem because I always change my motor oil every 5000 miles.","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2023",,
Only oil for Mercedes-Benz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jacqueline Lystrup,"I buy two of these 5 quart jugs for every oil change I do in my Mercedes-Benz AMG's.  Each one takes 9 quarts per oil change and this is easily the least expensive way to get that quantity.  I have an E63S AMG as well as an ML63 and this oil I will ever use.  I have seen some 5 quart oil advertised that appears to be the same thing but it came in a bag inside the box instead of giving you a plastic jug.  This will be a 5qt jug which is far better for giving you an empty jug to fill with a cap to take to your nearest oil recycling place after your oil change is finished.  Make sure never to mix synthetic oil with standard though.  If you have a BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Porsche, etc that's a European make, this is definitely the oil you're looking for.","Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023",,

Below the threaded lid is a foil seal - which is sealed loosly - allowing oil to spill. I'm sure the oil is a good product however the container is entirely inadequate and allows spillage during shipping. In addition packaging was minimal which also allowed the container to be bumped around probably causing more spill issues. Not only bad packaging but an environmental threat.

"Not BMW LL01 Approved Anymore, But Still Great Oil.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Phelan Trinh,"I always use Mobile 1, but just a note for those BMW owners that care; Amazon is stocking the newest formulation which isn't BMW LL01 approved anymore. Personally, I don't mind (lots of factors that us auto guys all don't need to go into), but just thought everyone should know. I heard that this is still the OEM stuff they use for Audi, Mercedes and Porsche. You can probably find the BMW approved stuff as old stock somewhere (look for BMW on the front as a listed manufacturer).","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2017",,

I THINK it is pretty good,4.0 out of 5 stars,BWH,"After checking online, researching forums, and asking mechanics, I decided on Mobile 1 for my Subaru. I've been quite satisfied with it, but could not legitimately say whether it has provided more benefit to my car's engine than another brand of oil could. It is impossible for me to quantify its effectiveness, so I can only rate it 4 stars based on the fact that though I've never had any issues with it and my car seems to be running well with it, I'm just not sure whether it is in fact better than lower cost alternatives.","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2016",,

Comparing this to the 5w-40 formula M 229.5 in a m272 engine, the formula m runs a bit quitter and probably have more additives, however it's also double the price.

I got six jugs this time (long commute) and they broke the order into 5+1 due to hazmat rules, no biggie.  I am writing this review as a word of warning that the box that had the 5 jugs in it had 1 jug with a pin-size hole leak in it, I am assuming from the warehouse since the safety bag in the box did not leak at all (+1 for backup plan).  I arrived home after dark and decided to unload the box into my garage before going in the house.  I could not see into the box and just grabbed 2 jugs and went.  Going back for more is when I realized I had a leak.  Looking down I noticed a hand-size oil mark on my slacks.

I know one mechanic who uses it and just takes the filter off mid year and empties it and fills it with clean Amsoil. Then at the end of the year he changes the oil and filter. So far no problems. It costs a lot more but you know what they say ""you get what you pay for"". I don't always go by this but in this case I wholeheartedly agree.

Since my truck has the old TBI 350 with out a roller cam shaft that people say need more ZDP (zinc) in it to protect the camshaft I tried to research what Mobil one had in their offerings (Mobil 1 standard, High mileage and extended). Took a little time as Mobil doesn't list it on their site I was able to find a Mobil 1Oil Product Guide .pdf that lists all their flavors and viscosities with Phosphorus/zinc levels and if it meets any manufacturer requirements. In my case looking at 5W-30 Extended performance had 800ppm Phosphorus and 900ppm zinc, standard Mobil 1 had the same but High Mileage has 1000ppm Phosphorus and 1100ppm Zinc. Off the top of my head I did compare this to what other fully synthetic brands were offering (Valvoline, Penzoil, Castrol), but I am pretty sure this High Mileage was better!

Not what once was. Your usage may vary,2.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,"I used to be a huge fan of Mobil 1 ever since I found out so many auto makers used it as their OEM oil. Once I bought a brand new car, I used Mobil 1 EP for the 2nd oil change and at first, the car felt amazing. Everything was smoother compared to the OEM Motorcraft oil. Then after about 1000-2000 miles, the smoothness went away and the oil level went down significantly. I almost had to put in half a quart before the next oil change. For whatever reason my car was burning this oil quickly which was very surprising since my car had less than 6000 miles. Its practically brand new. I tried Castrol Edge EP next and my oil level is now very stable compared to Mobil 1, I dont have to worry about topping it off every 2 or 3 weeks.
