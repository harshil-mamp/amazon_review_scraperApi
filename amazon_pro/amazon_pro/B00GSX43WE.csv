Brand I have been using for 50 years,5.0 out of 5 stars,RICHARD M,"Haven't changed the oil yet.  Was trying to find conventional Castrol 5w-30 and ended up going wIth the high mileage synthetic.  This will be the first synthetic I have ever used.  I am putting it in 91 Chevy pickup I bought new that now has165,000 miles.  Hoping it might reduce the cold start smoke from the valve guides.","Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2023",,
