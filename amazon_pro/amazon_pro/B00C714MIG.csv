A name you can trust!,5.0 out of 5 stars,BigL,"I've been using motul specifically 300v synthetic in all my bikes for the last 20 years starting immediately at the first 600 mile service/oil change. My only go to brand when it comes to quality motorcycle oil. Engine runs quite, gear changes always become noticeably smoother and precise. Have always recommended the brand to fellow riders and friends.","Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2023",,
Nothing but the best for my bike,5.0 out of 5 stars,Velantoni,If you are in the market for motorcycle oil don’t cheap out. The price is not cheap but motorcycles are BIG BOYZ toys. You want them to run well and last don’t buy the cheap stuff. The quality is worth the price to protect your investment,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2023",,
Good oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Justin,This is super fun putting in with the different color. Ensure you are careful when popping up the spout. Again good oil used it for ninja 400,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023",,

WIll be using this from now on.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tanner,"Ive always been a ""Oil is oil"" kind of guy but after running this stuff in my CBR1000 I have to say its changed my view. Not much performance wise but just engine noise in general. Bike seems quieter and the shifting clunk has gone in noise and feel. Also went over oil change intervals and the oil looked the same as when I put it in. Gotta love that. The green appearance threw me off at first....but its growing on me.","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2023",,
Track use.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amanda Zurlo,Excellent product but I’d recommend track use only. I change my oil after every one or two full trackdays after being hard on the bike. If you are riding the street basic oil brands like yamalube or whatever brand is just fine.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2023",,
This is the best oil you can get.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Maxwell Partridge,"266 reviews and over 250 are 5 stars, there is a reason for it.. Buy this oil, it is the easiest to work with in terms of pouring since the container has a build in funnel, and the oil itself is some of the highest quality I'v ever seen/felt when it comes to riding my motorcycles. I use it in a 04 CB599F Hornet and an 02 ZRX 1200R, it has smoothed down the ""CLUNK"" between gears either at idle or high rpm and I can almost feel the engine running happier with it.
Both engines are water cooled and on my CB599F Hornet I noticed an outer engine casing temperature drop of 4 degrees after using this product (same day within 30 minutes apart of temperature measurements in shade, both oils brought up to operating temperature..
It's such a high quality oil that I'll never use anything other than Motul oil unless absolutely necessary, shipping was SUPER fast, arrived 2 days earlier than it said it would even during this Covic 19 crap, you can't go wrong!","Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2020",,

Best oil I’ve used so far,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brandie E Smith,"I’ve got a 2005 Kawasaki Z1000 that has seen a few different oils in it’s lifetime. I’ve ran Rotella T 15-40, Mobil 1 Motorcycle 10w40, and Amsoil 10w40. Of those I’d say the Amsoil was the best but all of them left the bike with notchy shifting and harshness in the engine. The Motul is the only oil I’ve used that I could instantly tell a difference. Upon initial start-up the bike was WAY smoother and quieter. The shifting was easily the biggest difference. The notchiness was completely gone, it glides easily into the next gear. The downshifts were also a lot smoother. I also noticed the vibrations are much lower at highway speeds and I found myself speeding more as the vibrations would keep me from going too fast before. On top of all that the engine temps are about 10-15F lower and when the temperature does creep up at stop lights it goes down much quicker now than before. Needless to say this will be all I use going forward.","Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2019",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GRcWebuTL._SY88.jpg,
