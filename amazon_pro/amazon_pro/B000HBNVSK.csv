Great for ratchets,5.0 out of 5 stars,Zero Signal,"I read on a forum somewhere that this stuff works well for ratchets, especially the fine tooth (72 tooth and up) variety.
Well, I have a lot of ratchets.  I also have a lot of different types of lube.  I've used several different types on my ratchets-- moly lube, Lubriplate, silicone grease, engine oil, ATF, etc.  All of them have worked to one degree or another (except the moly grease, which gummed up a Husky ratchet to the point where it wouldn't work without a REALLY thorough cleaning).  I don't need another bottle of lube that'll get used once and sit on my shelf forever, especially not for something as pedestrian as lubing ratchets.
This line of reasoning made so much sense that I immediately ignored it and bought the damn bottle anyway.  I then went on a ratchet cleaning spree.
For lubing ratchets I've pretty much narrowed it down to Super Lube synthetic grease and Permatex Ultra Slick.  Super Lube is thicker and seems to work well on my older, coarse-tooth ratchets.  I have a couple of SK ratchets and one beefy old Williams that work better with a more viscous lube, and I think it's what Snap On supplies with their rebuild kits.
Everything else in my shop gets Ultra Slick.  I'm not sure if it's approved by any manufacturer but it's as slippery as the name implies and it sticks well to the ratchet pawls and teeth.  No, it won't instantly turn a clunky old ratchet into a buttery-smooth 110-tooth model but it's been working well in my shop for several years now.
It doesn't take much, either.  Unless I rebuild another engine, this bottle may last me a lifetime.","Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2023",,

"Great assembly lube, terrible packaging.  Spout leaks!",4.0 out of 5 stars,christopher.robot,"If you've ever worked with this stuff, you know what a mess it can be if you get it where you don't want it.  Well, be very careful how you store it - the included cap leaks horribly.  It's fine upright, but if it tips over or is stored on its side - the lube leaks right past the folding spout and all over the nearest surface(s).  Mine tipped over in a very inconvenient place - took hours to clean and wasted half the tube.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2023",,
