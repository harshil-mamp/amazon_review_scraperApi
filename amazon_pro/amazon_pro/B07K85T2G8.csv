"30WT, Non Detergent for Pressure Water Pump.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Iko the dog,"Valvoline is an American owned company and said it's 30 weight NON detergent oil is from a USA oil field. It was out of stock at 2 auto parts stores near me, so I forked out the extra $4. and had it overnight via Amazon!  This is what you'll need for the pressure washer pump, NOT the engine. There's no need to buy special pump oil at twice the cost, my Honda manual only said ""30 weight ND oil for the pump"". I ran the engine for a full tank of gas, pulled the pump filler plug and the oil looked fine, no foaming or anything out of the ordinary. My time is worth more than the extra $4. it cost me, as I didn't want to drive around town looking for 30WT ND, which used to be everywhere.","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2023",,
