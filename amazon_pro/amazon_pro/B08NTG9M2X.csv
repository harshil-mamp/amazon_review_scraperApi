175 k on the ACCORD,4.0 out of 5 stars,Andrew K. Barkley,"With 175K on the clock of our 2015 Accord, we are trying to keep her running strong. It is using about a quart between changes, not leaking but I understand Honda used low pressure / low friction piston rings, which work well up to about 100K miles then the oil leaks into the cylinder. I am trying this oil to slow the consumption, time will tell. That being said, I am a Pennzoil guy and have used their 100 percent synthetic in this car since new and everything looks good and clean on the valve train. Keep is up Pennzoil!","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023",,
Hyundai Santa Fe 2007,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kelvin R.,"Este lubricante le cayó como anillo al dedo a mi Santa Fe, el motor está más silencioso, sereno, más potencia, mejoró un poco el rendimiento de combustible, suave y lo mejor de todo es al encender en motor frío. Anterior a este aceite usaba Liquid Moly y cuando encendía hacia un ruido como de cadena pero con este aceite no se siente ni escucha nada.","Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2023",,
