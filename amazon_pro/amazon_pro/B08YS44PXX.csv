Quieted down my Toyota Tundra 5.7.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Scott B.,"I use 5w-30 in my 2016 Tundra 5.7 over the factory recommended 0w-20. For years I’ve been using Pennzoil Platinum Ultra but lately it’s been getting harder to find and quite pricey especially when your engine takes 8qts. I did the research and found that This Valvoline EP is a close second in product testing so I ordered it. My experience in the last few thousand miles has been that it has quieted down my engine a lot more than Pennzoil Platinum 5w-30 did. With Pennzoil Platinum I still had a slight ticking in the valve train with this Valvoline EP that tick is gone. Both are fantastic oils but in this case for two reasons I’ll stick with Valvoline EP going forward over the Pennzoil Platinum, price and performance.","Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2023",,

Don't Bother With Others,5.0 out of 5 stars,Semi in Tampa,"We used the 0W16 Valvoline FS in our Toyota Camry LE with 38K miles on it and got 5 more mpg [50mpg+ at 65 mph on level highway] than with the Toyota oil and our engine ran so quiet - better than new - that we had to keep checking the tach at stop lights to see if the engine was still running. Expect the same with the 5W30 in our Pontiac. Don't bother with other oils, even the ""factory original"" oils. They are inferior to Valvoline.","Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2023",,
Oil lasts a very long time before starting to get dirty.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rugged80,This is by far the best full synthetic oil I've used in my SHO. Any other full synthetic oil I've used got dirty too fast. Highly recommend this oil especially if your car has turbos like mine.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2023",,
