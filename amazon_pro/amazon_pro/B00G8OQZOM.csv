No visible level,3.0 out of 5 stars,Vitaliy R,"This is the 3rd or 4th time I am buying it. In the past, there was always a transparent line on the bottle, making it easy to measure how much oil is used. However, this time, there are liter marks but no transparent line, making it impossible to figure out how much oil is used or left. Why?","Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2023",,

OEM ONLY,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rick Kesecker,"Important to buy OEM only when you buy your motorcycle new. I bought four changes from the dealer so there would be no dispute if something went wrong during warranty.  I do my own oil changes as recommended in the maintenance schedule. I wrote them down in the owners manual and took a picture.
I continued to use OEM and now have 21,000 miles in two years.","Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2022",,

Noticeably smoother operation with genuine GN4.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gordon Freeman,"When working on a motorcycle, there are some things you just don't want to chance, as a maintenance issue can quickly become a safety issue. For me, oil is one of them.
I'm not sure what oil my used 2014 CB500X came with, but I can tell you that it shifts noticeably more smoothly and more quietly after switching to this oil, as the gearbox and engine share oil. Be sure to use a quality filter too! You can't go wrong for the money.","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2021",,

Good break in oil!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bmurray,"Used this to break in my Africa Twin on the first 3000miles I might actually just keep using it because I like it and its cheap and seems to last long. I have 2500 miles on my last oil change and its still gold and between my fingers, it feels like the friction modifiers are still really good. Sometimes you can tell when the oil is getting old or broken down either by color, smell or even by rubbing it between your fingers to feel if it's still silky like new or grippy and old. it still feels silky to me and the color looks nice so I'm gonna keep running it for another 1000 and check it.","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2019",,
Right Oil For My Motorcycle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Placeholder,"Correct oil weight is critical for a motorcycle as the oil lubricates both the motor, the clutch and the transmission.  Newer bikes have tighter tolerances and require a lower weight, slippery oil to lubricate everything properly.  This oil does that.  Great mileage and engine is running perfectly after four years.","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2021",,
