Good product but not as others described it!,4.0 out of 5 stars,Link82,"Other people posting pictures and commenting that they got disposable gloves and towels with a next due sticker as well. I didn't get any of that with my order.
I only got the oil and the filter.
Oil, filter, and labels all look good and legit.  I'll see how it goes on my second order next month. Price of oil and filter at the dealership near me is about 15-20 dollars more with taxes. Not much of a difference but through Amazon I get it at my house and I like working on my vehicles too.","Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2023",,

Looks legit.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Jyl Lopez,"Has oil and filter. Other reviews said it included rubber gloves, shop towel, a new gasket; however, it did not. Not a deal breaker. I’m really paying for the convenience of having it delivered to my house. The dealership is only 10 minutes away and the oil is the same price actually slightly cheaper could’ve got it from them.","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2023",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71I7Dk8BD3L._SY88.jpg,
