BEST OIL FOR YOUR BYKEEEE,5.0 out of 5 stars,Trey Feller,Don‚Äôt cheap out on cheap oil. Motul offers the best. The 7100 has a cleaning detergent that cleans while functioning. Also the patented ester core technology sticks to all things metal inside and just provides the smoothest shifts. I change oil 3-3500 miles every time and it never breaks down and get gritty feeling like other oils like mobile 1 would. 49k on my 750 and I beat on that bastard like my own son.
