Great price and oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,"I've run Pennzoil on a majority of my cars, it doesn't seem to thin out as much as other brands over the 5k mile oil change intervals","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023",,
I really like this oil.,5.0 out of 5 stars,AmazonShopperDavid,"Seems reasonably priced. And I’ve been using it for nearly 200,000 miles on a Gen. 3 Tacoma. So far it doesn’t burn a drop. But don’t delude yourself into being trapped by the promise of 10,000 mile oil changes. I always change at 5000. I don’t care what the engineers say. I’ve pulled apart engines that got the factory recommended 10,000 mile oil changes. All kinds of buildup in the inside. Looks like tar almost. Builds up on the ends of the rings and then they can’t expand and contract and next thing you’ve got scored cylinder walls and burning oil. 5000 miles for me. That’s when I change. Oil is far cheaper than new vehicles and engine rebuilds.","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023",,
Keep coming back to PP,5.0 out of 5 stars,JO,"Great price. Have tried other oils, might be subjective but, I think it stays ""fresher"" than other oils I have tried. I also like that this is made/derived from natural which means it's less wasteful during production.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023",,

It's good,5.0 out of 5 stars,Morton Inc.,I bought this to top off my car. It worked great for about the month it was in my car until I changed my oil,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023",,
"BEST TASTING MOTOR OIL OUT THERE! Mmmmmm, YUM!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Guitartec,"We used to use BBQ sauce on chicken, but now we used Pennzoil 10W30 made from naughty gerbil leavins. My old Camry 2.2l loves it and it keeps the inside of my 171k miles engine squeaky clean. This oil actually solved a slight smoke-at-start-up problem the engine had several years ago using Amazon Basics Synthetic and it hasn't come back since using Pennzoil made from Unnatural burrito Gas. Pennzoil is Oil-tastic and got the highest marks on the Project Farm testing on YT, second only to Amsoil which costs way too much.","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023",,

3 jugs for the price of an oil change,5.0 out of 5 stars,Blake & Jaclyn,We’ve been putting penzoil in our vehicles for years. My favorite part about ordering from this customer is that I end up getting enough for 2-3 oil changes for the price of going to the store to get one oil change. Shipping is always exactly when they say it will be.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2023",,
