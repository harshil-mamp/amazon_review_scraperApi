"Synthetic oil recommended, this is a known brand, and very good price",5.0 out of 5 stars,Snoosh,"Synthetic oil is more expensive but generally better than ""regular"" oil (if the engine is in good condition to begin with, including gaskets, etc.), since it holds its viscosity and does not thicken up when cold (makes cold-weather cranking and starting easier) nor thin when hot (protects engine).  This was for a new snow blower, and while their user manual just listed a very old specification for regular motor oil, their service folks said that they recommend synthetic.  Very bad to mix oils, even two good ""regular"" oils, it cuts lubricity and increases wear.  So, I thoroughly drained the tiny amount of regular oil that was in from the factory and put in this and things are good.  The user manual says to change oil after about 25 hours of operation, but I will do another change a bit sooner than that to help eliminate ""contamination"" from what ever film or puddles of the regular oil remained before putting in the synthetic.
This may or may not be corrected now, but the illustration in the Amazon photos showed, clearly, 16-oz (pint) on the containers, although the text description said ""quart"", and what arrived was quarts, which makes it a good price compared to most small-engine places for this same oil.
Sears, where I got the snow blower, carries several regular and synthetic oils with brand names that are undoubtedly fine but that I never heard of before, so I feel a bit better using a recognized brand with small-engine experience, Briggs & Stratton.  Companies have changed so much in recent years, bought and sold and gutted and sold again, so this may be an empty gesture, but I figured can't hurt, might help.
Now, we just need a bit of snow...","Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2013",,
Great Synthetic Oil that makes a difference,5.0 out of 5 stars,Customer,"I purchased two quart locally and soon discovered how good/great this oil is.  It makes my 27HP Kawasaki Hustler 60"" Zero Turn run like a champ.  The motor was doing fine on conventional 30w for about 5 years.  I changed to Briggs and Stratton full synthetic the end of last year and was so impressed.  This oil stays cleaner and after about 30 hours of running, it looks just like it did when I put it in.  I ordered three quarts to make an oil change and use in my other small engines on Amazon because it was a lot cheaper than my local stores.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2021",,
