Great for any car - Best for Classic Cars,5.0 out of 5 stars,jmk,"This is a **CONVENTIONAL** motor oil!  Not a synthetic.  It is perfect for all cars!  And it is better than synthetic motor oils for classic cars.  With classic cars, synthetic oils can deteriorate oil seals - - not all synthetic oils will, but some of them will.  That is NOT a problem with a **CONVENTIONAL** or organic motor oil.
When choosing a CONVENTIONAL motor oil, the best way to ensure best service life, best dirt suspension additives, best detergent additives and best base oil, is to go with a top brand.  Castrol is a top quality brand, made by BP (British Petroleum), which has been in business for a VERY long time.  Some of the top racing drivers (such as John Force!) use Castrol and only Castrol.  You would be very hard pressed to find a better brand and a better oil.","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023",,

Good oil.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Keith Bickel,"Been using it almost exclusively for 180,000 miles in my truck. Still dont have to add between changes at 5000 miles or so.
The packaging was an abomination. I got 3 of the 5 quart jugs & am unsure why they weren't just shipped in the Castrol packaging.. upright side by side. Instead they were packed in the worst possible configuration in a large flat box laying down with the spot for a 4th jug just sitting empty. I had a hard time carrying the box into the garage as it wanted to bend in 1/2 & kept trying to slip out of my arms. Very very poor. It's only the shipper's extra care that enabled the package to arrive intact. But hey that little bit of tape around the lids protected everything (he said as he rolled his eyes).","Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2023",,
