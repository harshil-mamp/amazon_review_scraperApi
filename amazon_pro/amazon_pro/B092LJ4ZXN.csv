Just Right for My Use Case,5.0 out of 5 stars,C Martinez,"It is remarkable the divergence of opinion one gets about synthetic oil. Despite the OEM guidance to use 0-20 in my 2007 Toyota Camry, invariably I'll get a mechanic who tries to push me down into a blend or just not use it at all. Who do I give more credence to? Toyota or a ordinary mechanic spouting out their truisms? Well I split the difference by viewing several viscosity test videos. It seemed pretty convincing to me. Synthetic performed best in a range of temperature enviroments.  I am in South Texas so the test thresholds are from Blazin' Hot to Freezin' Cold. Castrol hit the right price point and best reflected what I perceived to be my use case. Not the Oil Filter is another matter. I prefer the high bosch that I had in my Deville but it is not made for the Camry, so I use the next tier below this. My experience with the Bosch filter were seen every time I checked this dipstick. It was remarkable how clean the oil was over time. The maxim (often is but not always) Pay more Get more.","Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2023",,
Good oil,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alex,Use Castrol my entire life on all my cars. I know this says it can hold up 5K but with my car I have to change it 3K since it’s already dark brown. Over all though the car runs really smooth sometimes feels like it’s off,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2023",,

Castrol low phosphorus oil!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kurt Jordan,"This oil won't ruin your catalytic converter on your car,I use it in my sisters Toyota Camry 0W-20W","Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2023",,
Great oil & my #1 choice for our Toyota Sequoia V8.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gurka,"Prices on oil have increased, but this 3-pack was more cost-effective the last time I got oil. I use several favorite brands of oil, but Castrol is 1 that I have alway used with confidence. The Toyota V-8 is a marvelous workhorse of an engine. Changing the oil in my Sequoia takes longer & has more steps than my other vehicles, which is a good reason to use the best product & an oil that seems to do well with extended drain periods. I also have the spare-no-expense mindset on preventing engine wear while getting top protection. Sometimes I will be changing my oil & pondering how much the good oil costs, thinking how some shops would change the oil & filter at half of the cost of doing it myself & save me the time & mess. But, when I do it, I know it is done right, using the correct grade, right amount & high quality product. Drained as long as I choose & not over/under tightened.
All the mental & physical input required for my oil changes motivates me to get the most time & miles on every oil & filter change! With growing wiser, newer recommendations & advanced premium quality lubricants - I choose to change my oil no sooner than 12 months or 5,000 miles. Also, I used the high-mileage & regular mileage versions of this oil & there was no noticeable difference. I prefer the High-Mileage formula since the vehicle is older, with 100K miles+. The reg & high-mileage tend to be around the same price when I shop around.","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2022",,
