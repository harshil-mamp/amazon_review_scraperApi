It is doing the job.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Great One,"I have tried different oils for my F150 over the last couple of years. The first two oil changes I used Motorcraft semi synthetic. After that initial breaking in phase, I switched to full synthetic. I would generally buy the cheapest full synthetic available as they all meet Ford specifications. Royal purple was only five or six dollars more than Pennzoil that came from Natural gas. The Pennzoil product was fine however, I did not notice any change in my mpgs However, to be fair, the engine did run smoother. This afternoon I switched to Royal Purple. I will normally run 87 octane in my truck after about 50 miles felt like I was running 91 octane I have never ever noticed a huge difference when switching oil products until I put Royal Purple in. All I know is if my truck continues to perform the way it has been in the last 50 miles I will be a royal purple customer for life. I will update in about a month I drive about 700 miles a week.
Update: I am now at about 6k with Royal Purple. Engine is quieter at start up and idles smooth but the performance I noticed at first is gone. Mpgs is up 1.2 but is it the summer blend of fuel or the oil? No oil burning and the oil visibly looks fine-the purple dye goes away after a few hundred miles. I probably would buy it again if it’s on sale but I am not convinced that the oil is doing anything special. I think the oil would be fine til 7-8k but that’s up to you all. My driving is all freeway so going 8k is fine. Please don’t change modern cars every 3k-you’re just wasting time and resources.","Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2023",,

Don’t waste your money,4.0 out of 5 stars,Robert,"Have been using royal purple for years this formula is worse than conventional oil for longevity, I’ve got 3300 miles and it’s time to change it , as to using synthetic blend Ford oil in my 2018 f150 with 40k miles I get 6k miles per interval. Within the first 500 miles it was already turning brown from purple, opt for the HPS formula for a few bucks more. Very disappointed In Royal Purple with this formula!!!","Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2023",,
