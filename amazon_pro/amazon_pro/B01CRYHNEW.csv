Excellent oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Michael Lowe,"Been using the High Mileage 10w 30 since May 2022. My car had 76,000 miles at that time. Had switched from a valvoline synthetic blend. As time progressed, the car just felt smoother and smoother, as if it healed. Fuel consumption got better, I assume because the engine felt as if it worked less to give power. This oil works great. I get around 8,000 to 8,500 miles from a bottle, depending on how I drive. Wish the price was cheaper, mainly because to ship this oil to my country ""Guyana"", the total cost runs me $84 USD (freight, shipping, duty etc.).","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2023",,
