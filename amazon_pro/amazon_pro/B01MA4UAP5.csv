Test results show one of the best oils in the market!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bulgar,"Pennzoil Ultra Platinum scores very well in oil studies and tests, and for the price, you just can't beat it. The top three oils from the Project Farm test indicate Amsoil, Red Line, and Pennzoil Ultra Platinum. Pennzoil is a win for value as its much cheaper, Amsoil costs about a $100 for 6 quarts, and Red Line is somewhere around the $80s. This is around $50 and scores just as well as the other two.","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2023",,

Great for my hyundias,5.0 out of 5 stars,OK chief,"I use pz 5w30 for my 2017 1.6T tucson limited (4.5qts) and pz 5w20 for my 2.0 elantra limited (4.2qts). I change every 5k on the dot. Save your leftover new oil into it's own jug, at some point you'll get an extra OC. Check your capacity simple google search. It's unwise to just blindly dump the full 5qts without knowing your recommended capacity. It's typically advised to run less than more oil in general.
I wouldn't go 100k, even over 10k, without an oil change I don't care what the manufacturers claim lol. Buy your bulk filters on Amazon as well. Don't forget to replace your crush washer. I got a magnetic fill bolt to monitor any internal wear just a suggestion. Overall very pleased at performance and price, can always count on this.

Great Motor Oil for Ford F-150 3.5L EcoBoost,5.0 out of 5 stars,Edgar,"Decided to try this engine oil for my Eco-boost after using Valvoline Modern Engine oil and Mobil 1 extended performance since it was one of the best rated full synthetic oil on the market right now. After doing my research ( I recommend doing your own research as well) I found out this motor oil is approved by FORD ( Ford WSS-M2C946-A) and is a good motor oil for Turbo applications since the Eco-boost is turbo and turbo engines are VERY hard on oils. it has better additives for wear protection, cleaner pistons, for extreme temperature protection (which is Great for turbocharged engines) and overall extreme performance.  If your're planning to use this motor oil for your Eco-boost I suggest to use either WIX XP or FRAM Ultra Synthetic oil filter for the best filtration/protection. After comparing Valvoline and Mobil 1 I've narrowed it down to Pennzoil since it has the best additives, best wear protection, best temperature protection , and all made with Natural Gas.  I will keep using Pennzoil Ultra Platinum for my Eco-boost. I highly recommend for any Ford Eco-boost owner to use this oil for your Eco-boost as well if you trying to get the best protection.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2020",,
The best Dexos1 0W-20 motor oil available.,4.0 out of 5 stars,David A.,"Pennzoil Ultra Platinum now it a flashy yellow jug as opposed to the previous black container.
This oil is probably one of the very best Group III (petroleum based synthetic) motor oils on the market, not so sure that it is worth the extra $ over the non-Ultra Platinum oil in the long run as it's only benefit is that Pennzoil states the Ultra keeps the inside of the engine 25% cleaner.
This oil does not compare with Ester based synthetic oils but only a few 0W-20 oils are like Redline, Motul 300V and a few others.
Many people mistakenly believe that Amzoil is a PAO or Ester based synthetic motor oil but their line is just Group III as well and none even carry the Dexos1 certification.
I held back 1 star because this oil can be hard to source at times and it is a very expensive Group III synthetic oil.
My general take is that if you own a newer GM product that specifies the use of 0W-20 this oil is probably the very best product available that is Dexos1 licensed and you certainly cannot go wrong with it.","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2017",,

A Real Fine Oil - From an Industrial Tribologists POV,5.0 out of 5 stars,Robert,"Let me start by stating that I work as an industrial gas turbine operator & controls tech and I'm a jack of all trades in that role e.g. I've been there and done that so to speak. Now, what that means is I have been trained in tribology (amongst loads of other titles), no not the study of those pesky Tribbles from Star Trek =)
Tribology is study of friction between two bodies in motion (friction) and lubrication etc... So I can tell a junk oil from a good oil pretty well. I run custom oil analysis when needed but not often. I ran this oil and performed some tests and it came out much better than most. Note: Most oils in the 21st century are real good. We're talking about marginal improvements here. But over the life of an engine it can and will matter to some of us. I prefer to keep a vehicle once it's paid off. Instead of going back in debt immediately... crazy I know! In those cases you want the best margin of increase over mean average you can get, even if only by a factor or .5
This oil is right up there with Amsoil and Redline. Though cheaper and less rare, though it is easier to buy through Amazon in my case.
Will this add 100,000 miles to your already old car or truck? Probably not. But for new car owners it may be worth swapping to after a good break-in with normal oils.
I've heard this oil has been ceased production (rumor?), not sure where I read that but I hope it's not the case. If so I may swap back to Mobile 1.","Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2015",,
Outstanding performance for the price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rob H.,"Been using synthetic oil continuously for every oil change for well over 15 years now in any vehicle I've owned and this stuff is magic for the price I paid a few months ago.
Over the years I've used various other synthetics ranging from brands such as Mobil1, Lucas, Castrol Edge, Royal Purple, Amsoil and this stuff when it was marketed as Pennzoil Ultra before it was formulated from natural gas.
Now I can't give an honest assessment on how it performs and its cleaning/lubricating properties whether through heavy towing, racing, ultra high & low temperature performance, fuel economy,, etc but my late model Kia Sorento AWD V6 drives very smooth with Ultra Platinum which I've used the last 3 oil changes.
I'm aware there's a few YouTube vids on synthetic oil comparisons for those conscientious about the life of their vehicle/engine. Synthetic oil is always the best option for the life of your engine and Pennzoil Ultra Platinum is a real treat for it at an affordable price.

I was considering other high performance oil for VQ that is known to run hot, there a noticeable difference for the maximum oil temp after pushing the engine with WOT. Before with Nissan OEM Ester oil, my car would consistently operating at 240F, which is within range per mfg manual. However, after a few runs, the car was approach 265 which was a bit much for my comfort level. Now, it is consistently at 200 with normal driving and I rarely see 240 even after a few hard runs. It also seemed to cool down quicker when pushed to the limits, which seems to me that the oil is doing a its job at not only keeping the oil temp in check but also does a great job at dissipating heats  as well.
As a trade off for more efficient thermal cooling, it does take a few minutes longer for the oil to get the engine to good operating temperature on a cold start but it's something I'm willing to live with as I don't drive it in cold weather as often. With all things considered, this is a great oil for my needs that does not break my wallet for every 3000 miles oil changes and no doubt would be beneficial even if you don't have an oil cooler.","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2021",,

As far as the rebate success chance - I've submitted a handful, I've found out through personal experience that it's really hit or miss. The last rebate I sent via their website out of the 2 - 5 qt jugs, I only got a refund for one of the 5 qt jugs while the invoice clearly states quantity of 2 that I purchased. In addition one of the times on another purchase some 2 months later I got a letter in the mail stating my rebate was denied for no apparent reason. I recently submitted a rebate on some Pennzoil Platinum High Mileage that I am waiting on the rebate check for, so we will see if that one goes through.
That being said, if the rebate does go through, and depending on the current price on here at the time of purchase paying $3 a qt for a high quality Full Synthetic is really a amazing deal.","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2019",,

"Great oil, highly recommended",5.0 out of 5 stars,Igor V.,"I've been using Mobil1 for years, and I really trust them a lot. I watched a video from ""Project Farm"" on YouTube a while back on oil comparison. They were comparing this oil against Amazon Basics full synthetic oil. This oil did really well when compared to Amazon Basics, Mobil1, Redline, Royal Purple, and probably a few others. What can I say, that was enough evidence of performance for me to put it in my engine.
I also think it's important to point out that while not all oil is the same, one can't and in my humble opinion shouldn't ignore real world performance. In addition to this critical factor, to me price was a big factor. While I usually get 5qts of Mobil1 5w20 and a filter for around $45 to $50, I was able to get this oil with a filter for around $35. So far my engine has been running on this oil for a month, and guess what, NO DIFFERENCE so far between this and Mobil1. I recommend this oil.","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2021",,

Some of the best oil out there,5.0 out of 5 stars,Autobahn97,"This oil actually starts its life at a gas and is built up from there which is pretty cool but if you are specifically shopping for this oil you probably already know this.  It is supposed to have superior cleaning properties as compared to Mobile 1 oil which is more popular and less costly.  I only have 1000 miles on it so I can't comment if its better or not but my truck - 2013 F150 3.5L turbo EcoBoost is notoriously dirty - or the valves tend to get dirty which is common for modern Gas Direct Inject turbo engines because the gas is injected directly into the cylinder and not just out side of it like Multi point fuel injection.  The good news is direct inject is a bit more efficient however the bad news is that the gas does not have the opportunity to pass over the engine valves and clean them as gas is a solvent so engine oil will bake onto the vales and build up eventually causing problems.  The idea is this oil does better in the GDI turbo engine and bakes and cakes on to the valve less.  I'm not sure if its related to oil but the EcoBoost also chews up spark plugs - at least the ones in my truck so I replaced them at 30K miles and that make it run better too.  Anyway this is the theory behind this oil and why you would choose to pay more for it.  The best price I found was certainly on Amazon plus it shows up at my house in 2 days so a no brainer.  All and all I think I paid about $15 more for this oil than the Mobile 1 I previously purchased at my local warehouse club.  I'm not sure if it will make a big difference but for $15 more an oil change (I change my own oil) I figure enough people vouched for this oil, including ford mechanics,  that I would just give it a shot.","Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2017",,

First time shipped with no spills.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yasen Angelov,"I think that this is the best synthetic oil considering the price and quality of the product. It was on sale for $20 bucks per 5 quarts and I bought 2 jags. This is the first time when I buy engine oil from Amazon that comes without any spills. In the past, every time I buy engine oil from Amazon, I got some bottles squished from the shipping and had to call Amazon customer service and deal with the issue.
Generally, I am not a brand loyal when it comes to buying synthetic oil. The Amazon Basic is a very good product too and I buy it when it is on sale. I think this one is better but does it justify the premium over the Amazon Basic, not really if you change your oil every 5,000 to 7,500 miles. If you like to change the oil every 10,000 miles, then I would say this is one of the best products on the market.","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2022",,

Excellent oil.,5.0 out of 5 stars,JROC,"This has become my favorite go to oil. Before I started running the Pennzoil Ultra oils I use to only use legit full synthetics from Redline and occasionally Amsoil. While they are both excellent oil I honestly prefer the Pennzoil. I know some so-called oil experts Will likely argue that Redline and Amsoil are much better oils than the Pennzoil Ultra and they may even post a link or some oil data sheet to prove their point but I honest just prefer the Pennzoil Ultra. Even at near the same cost I choose the Pennzoil. My 03 Ford Lightning with 163K miles on it just runs so smooth and quiet with it. Even when I had my old modded Terminator when I was mostly running Redline 5W-30 I tried the Pennzoil Ultra on my last oil change in it and was impressed with it. Before I started running Redline and occasionally Amsoil I ran Mobil 1 5W-30 and then switched to German Castrol. I feel that the Pennzoil Ultra, Redline, Amsoil oils are all pretty close in being of similar quality, and I feel that both my boosted 03 SVT's ran noticeably better on these oils than with Mobil 1 or GC.
There are some negatives to the Pennzoil Ultra though. For one it has gotten pretty costly. Pretty much in the same price range as Amsoil and Redline. Also like Amsoil and Redline you can't hardly buy it as an over the counter oil anymore. Most stores that sell oils use to sell the older version of Pennzoil Ultra, but now I have to order it online. Another thing, I've personally never tried Royal Purple, but many people put it on the same level as Redline and Amsoil just like I did to Pennzoil Ultra, and you can get RP in most auto parts stores and for noticeably less than you can get Pennzoil Ultra, Redline, or Amsoil.
Still Pennzoil Ultra has become my favorite, go-to oil and I don't see me switch from it any time soon as I have no reason to.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2015",,

The purest oil you can buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Herbert L.,"At this time there are no other products like this one offered on the market. What many people don't know is how pure this oil is because natural gas, from which this product is made, is a ""gas"" that naturally has few contaminates when extracted from the ground. On the other hand, petroleum, from which most motor oil is produced, is very ""dirty"" with usually dozens and dozens of various combinations of contaminates. The contaminates must be removed by various refinery processes developed over past decades to produce better and more useful motor oils. However, even with these various processes there are still many contaminates left, that over time, miles, and most especially careless attention to properly timed oil changes, can produce sludge within an engine. Simply put, sludge is the accumulation of ""drop outs"" of those contaminates inside an engine that were not removed by processes used by a particular refining method. Even as good as I believe this product to be, by following your vehicle manufacturer's requirements and guideline that apply to engine oil type and specified oil changes intervals you should be OK. I just like to hedge my bets with what I trust to be the best.","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2021",,

Best Motor Oil For the Money!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brian H.,"Pennzoil: Pennzoil used to have a bad reputation of sludge buildup. Not anymore! Pennzoil is one of the best motor oil brands out there. Quaker-State, Shell, Pennzoil are within the same family. Pennzoil Platinums base oil are made from Natural Gas. From my understanding, it has fewer impurities than crude oil.
Price: 5 Quart Jug for $24.97 is a great price! Sometimes, Pennzoil would run a promotional rebate and the most recent one is if you buy 10 quarts you can get a $25 E-Gift Card. (Beware: For some reason, here on Amazon the price fluctuates and sometimes it’s either sold by Amazon or by a third-party)
Bottle/Jug: 5 quart jug includes a see through measurement to know how much motor oil is left in the jug. Two easy grab handles and the jug itself is the same from Shell Rotella and Quaker-State.
Usage: I used this oil on my 2021 Mazda 3 Hatchback with the 2.5 I4 Naturally Aspirated Engine (No Turbocharger). I used the Ultra Platinum 0w-20 and so far, it seems to run a bit smoother and have a tad bit better fuel economy. Mazda Engines have high compression (Skyactiv Technology) and it seems this motor oil fits better. Just feels smoother, quieter, and a bit better in fuel economy. I always do an oil change every 5,000 miles or once a year. You can go longer in miles if you have a premium oil filter.
Verdict: Almost every motor oil that is certified with the latest ratings by the API and ILSAC are great motor oils. Pennzoil Ultra Platinum is no exception. On YouTube, ProjectFarm has done a test on the Ultra Platinum and it did very well against the more pricer, Amsoil. My only gripe with the Ultra Platinum is that it’s not yet Dexos approved.","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2022","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CJXdTHXUL._SY88.jpg

"So much inaccurate information... this is a good oil, as are many others.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Summit,"It's good oil- if you look at reputable sources which have independently tested this oil, they are all complimentary. There are so many urban legends about oil and so many anecdotal stories from people, it's just bordering on ridiculous mostly. I retired as a senior manager and engineer with a major domestic auto manufacturer and have worked in Germany with a major auto group as well. I'm not a lubrication engineer, but I've sat in many engineering meetings with people who are so I have a pretty good grasp on the subject. Having campaigned a million dollar race car for years, my crew and engine builders have shared a lot of information with me as well.
Most important thing- change your oil on time. If you aren't getting tests done to determine when that is, adhere to the manufacturer suggestion. If you drive hard or in mountainous terrain or tow, follow the 'severe duty' schedule in the manual. While under warranty, if your engine fails you WILL be asked to provide service history. I've been involved in several cases of engine or turbo failures where people couldn't produce documentation and they ended up not getting a warranty claim. Oil is cheap, engines aren't.
Oil which meets the specifications from your car's manufacturer are the right ones to use. The brand doesn't matter, as long as it meets the standards specified by the engine maker. A LOT of research goes into bearings, clearances, materials and lubrication... some guy who works in a shop does not have a better grasp on those things than the manufacturer, although they think they do.
You can switch from synthetic back to conventional if you want to- the urban legend that says you can't is ridiculous and untrue.
The whacky stories about one oil causing engine knock, massive consumption, HUGE fuel economy changes, power changes you can feel- it's all fiction. A Camry isn't going to pull 30hp more on one oil over another if both oils are the same viscosity.
Don't believe the hype- buy quality oil that is appropriate for the car and your engine will last a long time.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2019",,
For the price this oil is on par with the best race oils,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mitch,"This is the best best oil you can get for the price. They have had the 5w-30 on sale almost all the time for $23-24 for a 5q bottle of the ultra platinum full synthetic. That’s a quality of oil that should sell for twice that. And you can safely run 5w-30 in any engine regardless of if it wants 0w-20 or whatever it calls for, it won’t be as efficient, but it’s going to provide better wear protection. My Volvo is super oil sensitive as most Volvo’s are, and being turbo charged it consumes a little oil and will act up when it’s less then half a quart low. This oil for reason doesn’t get consumed nearly as fast as mobile 1 or Castrol edge did for me, my turbo spools up better, my engine purs with this stuff in it. When I got the car the PCV system was clogged with gunk and there was signs that the previous owner used cheap gas and wasn’t the greatest on oil changes and I’ve been using this oil with top tier gas you can get at QT or a few other gas stations and RXP and the gunk has melted away over a year or 4 oil changes and the inside of my engine looks way way better now. I was worried all that gunk getting passed through the tailpipe would foul out my cat so it was a relief when it was obviously getting dissolved into this oil instead. Higher detergent levels and stabilizers keep the ph in check while it cleans the engine, good stuff for a turbo too. I know how fanatical people can be over oil, but you can read the test results and see what additives each oil has and the science doesn’t lie nowadays, they know what to put in the oil, it’s a question of who’s doing it and how much are they charging for the good stuff, this oil has all the good stuff and a lot of it and it’s half the price of anything close to it on the charts. That’s all you really need to know.","Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2020",,

This Ultra Platinum is amazing and works wonderfully in my car. What a difference this product makes! I cant tell you how many people (mechanics included) have told me...""oil is oil"". They are all so so wrong! I dont know how ANY sensible person can say such a thing! I know alot of mechanics and shop techs say this just so you will let them use their garbage oil that they pump and pour into your vehicle!!! But some people actually believe that nonsense...oil is NOT oil! The quailty and lack of quality of an oil make a difference of night and day! Superior cold start is just one of MANY examples that this oil provides! It doesnt break down the way regular oils do! It provides many additives that protect your engine in so many ways and the list is long! Just be sure to shake the bottle very well before opening and pouring because the beneficial additives tend to accumulate to the bottom of the jug after being manufacured on bottled. Thorough shaking of the jug will remedy that problem and ive proved that with my own testing and application. Do the research yourself and see exactly how much better this oil is than not only regular motor oil, but also other similar full synthetic specialty oils. Pennzoil is King of the field! But whatever you do, do not listen to the naysaying people that say ""oil is oil"" and try getting you to use regular conventional motor oil. Most mechanics, shop techs and oil change facilities want to use the cheapest product available and make the most money off of you that they can!!! And dont go to those ripoff lube centers that charge you a ridiculous amount of money for a full synthetic oil! AND NEVER USE A ""SYNTHETIC BLEND"" ITS A SCAM! Full Synthetc Oil ONLY! Get yourself a full synthetic oil filter too or at least a decent alternative , dont use the garbage filters that all of the lube change places use! Trust me on all of this.

Great Oil For Extreme Climates And Maximum Protection,5.0 out of 5 stars,JT,"Short story: This oil is great, it immediately quieted down the engine and made it start and run a lot better. Was recommended this over royal purple for its cold flowing performance. It's also one of the purest synthetic oils on the market since its made from natural gas. (No fake synthetics)
Long story: I recently purchased one of my dream cars, a 2010 Honda Accord EX-L V6 with 66,000 original miles. And since it's a car I want to keep in good shape for a very long time, I only want to use the best. I was disappointed to see that the honda dealer had recently changed the oil with conventional oil shortly after I bought the car! A relatively late-model car with low mileage like this one should definitely be running full synthetic or at least a synthetic blend. After doing many hours of research I found that royal purple was one of the best oils out there and decided to use it. That was until I started reading comments about trouble with it flowing in cold weather. I later went to their website and found that they recommend it to be used in ""temperate climates"". I live in Nebraska, and would hardly call it a ""temperate climate"". It gets over 100F in the summer and goes well below 0F in the winter. So after a friend recommended this to me for its cold flowing performance in his truck during the winter, I decided to go with this instead. I am happy to say that this oil had been great. It has drastically quieted down the engine and it even runs and revs a little smoother so far. I will definitely continue to use this oil and might consider switching to the high milage version of this at 125,000 miles or so to prevent any leaks.
Note: I went with the ultra platinum over the regular platinum because I drive my vehicles hard. Good stuff!","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2020",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aDKS48iPL._SY88.jpg,

"I want to believe, but I'm not convinced, yet...",3.0 out of 5 stars,tollynollywozzy,"Since reading the reviews on BITOG and as I'm a rather transparently suggestible type when it comes to synthetic oils I gave Pennzoil Ultra Platinum a shot for two drain cycles at intervals of 3000 and 4000 miles respectively. I drive a 1996 Toyota Camry v6 with ~ 168,000 miles on the clock, so in all honesty this oil in my engine can be likened to using a Ferrari to plow a corn field (one should only use a Lamborghini for that).
That said, it does run very smoothly. I am highly anal-retentive about engine maintenance and  scrupulously track everything going on by the letter. One of the positives is that I've noticed is that the engine oil at the time of my first change, appeared almost new as I drained it, which was fantastic. I sent off for a UOA kit and when the results came back, it showed no engine wear from the last report some 5000 miles earlier. Not minimal. None. Which was impressive. Now for the drawbacks. As I've said I'm a bit of Nazi about my car, so I maintain it with freakish Germanic dedication, however, I do notice that using this oil I tend to get back a quart less upon drain after a cycle is finished.
Did a leak-down test. nothing wrong, so possibly engine wear; maybe, but Toyota Camrys of this era ten to go for 300k+ miles at a go, so it seems unlikely. MPG is an amazing 30.12 mpg for a car of this vintage (according to the EPA.gov website says I should get 21mpg on a good day running downhill with the wind at my back. The last culprit: the oil itself. I have no proof of this, it's just a suspicion but I feel like the natural gas components being burned in the engine at a rate of about 1 qt/ 1k miles.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2014",,

Actually a better value than regular oil?,5.0 out of 5 stars,Matthew H. Reed,"I could not believe it. This oil, despite costing more money than conventional oil, may be saving me some money. Others have said it can improve your MPG, and I thought that was crazy. I bought the oil because I have a high mileage Toyota 4Runner that I care a lot about, so I wanted the best for it. I also wanted the extra cleaning powers of synthetic, and this synthetic rated second to Amsoil on project farm.
The low friction properties must be what does it, or I don't know what, but my MPG has gone from 17.5 average to 20 average. And I had a lot of highway miles before the change contributing to that 17.5 calculation, the 20.0 MPG has been produced mostly on a mix of city and highway driving. When I go on a long trip and rack up mega highway miles it may go higher! And yet Toyota publishes a max highway mileage of 19MPG for my 4L V6, and I'm doing better than that!
An improvement from 17.5MPG to 20MPG over a 6000 mile change interval could save me about 53 gallons of gas in that interval, or over $100!!! (Hypothetically) I'm just happy my engine seems to like the oil better, although it DID NOT quiet the ticking noise from my engine, so I wouldn't buy this expecting it to cure engine noises either. I don't blame the oil for the noise, I think it's my valve clearance.
I would say don't buy this oil with the intent to increase your MPG. Buy it because it's a great synthetic oil with extra cleaning powers and a longer change interval, although being the car enthusiasts we are I still won't run it longer than about 6k miles. However, be pleasantly surprised if your MPG magically goes up. This might happen more often with old engines like mine, that are needing some extra cleaning power. I don't know if it would change the MPG of a new engine as much.
Per the other reviewers comments I shook the bottles before pouring it in, I guess the additive package can separate? I shook them all first so I never saw stuff in the bottom once they were empty. You want that stuff in there, according to the manufacturer.

Excellent oil for turbo charged Forester.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Souky,"Original owner of an 06 Forester XT here (202k odo reading).  I've sampled several synthetic over the years, and Pennzoil Ultra Platinum 5w30 seems to be the best overall.  Quieter operation.  Smoother idle.  Minimal evaporation lost & consumption; less than quarter of a quart at 3k mileage mark.  MPG speaking, I haven't noticed any difference (1/4 city + 3/4 hwy).  My oil change interval is at 5k, but sometimes  up to 7k with no noticeable drawbacks.
Price wise for performance and protection, it's hard to beat.  The next step up would be a much pricier Amsoil, which also requires subscription and has to be shipped, unless you live near an authorized distributor.  You can get Ultra Platinum just about every where, including hardware stores and outlets.
MSRP tends to fluctuate when buying a single 5qt jug, but on average it gets down to around $32 when purchase in a case of 3.  For DIY folks, it's less than $50 for quality oil & filter.

Far exceeded my expectations of Pennzoil after a year of use.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dennis,"I was raised with the thought mentality of vehicle maintenance. (My father was a machanic). 30yrs ago, He started me out on changing oil, brakes, spark plugs when I was 7. So I’m a real stickler when it comes to a vehicle and upkeep. When it comes to certain products or parts, I have my go-to’s. Most of which came from my dad as what he’s experienced with his and other peoples vehicles. When it came to oil, pennzoil was not on that list. Castrol, Mobil, Valvoline. That’s it. And wix for the filter. (I’ve still yet to use Mobil). I used castrol when I was younger, moved to Valvoline when I worked for them, and after. Working for Valvoline, I learned a lot about motor oils and new technologies in production and the make up. Since vehicles have changed so much in todays time, and oil prices have risen, I started looking on Amazon and decided to research this oil a bit more. Price point was right where I wanted. I ended up deciding to try it. So far, after 3 oil changes and a year later, I must say I’m highly impressed. I’ve only ever used WIX XP filter on my vehicle since day one. I drive 90% highway miles, and change my oil/filter every 6,000 miles. I know I could go further per Ford, WIX, Pennzoil recommendations/statements. But like I said, I’m a bit anal. Also, I’m not typically easy going. I go 80mph down highway, and lay into it when I have to. The car sees 100 probably more times in a week than most see in a lifetime. And faster when there’s no other cars around and it’s straight. So far, at 102,000 miles, oil still drains out slightly discolored from the amber color and translucent. If not, more so since the switch. My oil filter is a large contributor in that, but not to take it away from the oil itself. So I highly recommend this product for its durability, cleanliness, purity, life. Not every oil can take all the elements my car sees and not sheer and breakdown quick. That goes for my driving, weather in Ohio, etc etc. I also use this in my wife’s ‘18 grand caravan. Which has worse extremes since it’s 99% in town short trips. Work is a 15min drive across town and shut off. And she’s always running late so she’s not easy either. It gets changed more frequently. Oil has held up great in it, and I’ve noticed it coming out cleaner using this and the wix xp on it. But we got it used with 40k miles on it. Since her oil light is 10k miles, and most people don’t use correct oil for vehicles, I can only imagine how oil was changed and probably with conventional before we got it. 🤷🏼‍♂️ So that’s another testament to this oil. If you do proper maintenance and use quality products, the filter will filter out more deposits and carbon, the oil will stay cleaner and be able to pick those up to take to the filter, and it won’t be able to build up and leave sludge/deposits to where it comes out black as night every time. And this oil has proven to do so.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2022",,

Additive package does indeed drop out.,4.0 out of 5 stars,shaunie81,"This is super hard to find. The only place that I find that carried the 5W-30 was Amazon. It’s their premium product and I drive a turbo charged WRX. I can confirm that the additive package does “drop out”. I’m not sure if you need that brown stuff. I did shake it up. Outside temp was 38 F. I’m a little disappointed, never saw any of this nonsense in Mobil 1.
Update:
Did some research on the additive drop out and per Pennzoil it’s a normal occurence. Still hard to believe that this is normal. Shook up the container with the rest of the oil dribblings and poured that additive it into the car. Overall have not noticed a difference in gas mileage or performance. Using Mobil 1 extended performance filters so figure if it’s junk it will get filtered well. This is still a top rated oil. Buying it by the jug makes the most sense since the quart bottles are almost 9-10 bucks a pop.

Pennzoil Ultra Platinum 5W-30 is NOT Dexos1,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cat,"This doesn't show any sign of dexos1. When you go to their website and look at the specification for this oil, it tells you that this is dexos1 certified. But when I ordered the Pennzoil Ultra Platinum 5w-30 it doesn't show dexos1 or even the license at the back. Is this just because of the new packaging. Now I'm really hesitant to put this on my Chevrolet Traverse.
Update: I called Pennzoil's customer service and they told me that even though it's not in the bottle, their product is still dexos certified. The data sheets on their website is correct. This is just a marketing decision because they are being charged a few cents for putting that in the bottle. And they are in transition to dexos Gen 2. He said sooner we will see Gen 2 stickers on their bottle which is also backward compatible.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2017",,

(Updated) Good Oil If You Don't Mind Being Screwed Out Of the Rebate!,3.0 out of 5 stars,Tony No Baloney,"8.12.2018 Update: I feel compelled to update my review since I did ultimately get the rebate. I don’t know if it was a result of contacting Amazon CS or a mistake by Pennzoil to send the rejected postcard notification in the first place.
Let me say upfront that I am certain that this oil is of high quality so I wont go into that. You really cant go wrong with any name brand oil provided it is of the correct type and weight for your vehicle. Now for the reason I gave this oil 3 stars; I selected this brand because of the rebate associated with it at the time, $10 per 5 quart jug, limit 2 per household. Fast forward to today 7/30/2018 and instead of the rebate I got a postcard stating that my submission didn't qualify because it was a ""duplicate submission"". Knowing this was in error I tried to reach the rebate center listed on the rebate form to follow up on this. What I got was a ""Forbidden"" message in big black letters. Therefore Pennzoil and Shell (mother corp) will be forbidden next time I need oil!","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2018",,

NO SEAL WHEN YOU OPEN THE CAP ON THE BOTTLE!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,Alex Park,"I gave it a 3 star because when I first got the package, the cap seems like it was opened and there was no seal when you opened the cap. I was a little skeptical because it seems like someone opened it already but I still poured it in my vehicle. Other than that, I'm a huge fan of using Pennzoil Ultra... But I wasn't sure if it was actually the Pennzoil Ultra itself because there were no seal when I opened the cap. I hope it is and I will give an update.
Whoever is the shipper should never open the white seal. The cap should have a white seal after you open the cap on the bottle and I didn't see the seal when I opened the cap so I just had a feeling that someone opened the seal.

Early comparison of performance comparison of Pennzoil Ultra Platinum 5W-30 to Amsoil Signature Series 5W-30,3.0 out of 5 stars,RBK,"I had been using Amsoil Signature Series 5W-30 in a 1998 Honda Odyssey which performed very well all the way out to 15,000 miles.  For comparison, I thought I would give Pennzoil 5W-30 Ultra Platinum a try.
I am about 2,000 miles into the Ultra Platinum and what I have observed so far is that the engine appears to be running hotter (202-204 degrees F on Pennzoil vs 194-198 degrees F Amsoil).  On startup, lifters are a bit noisier on Pennzoil but that could because of the relatively light viscosity of the newer oil (2,000 miles on Pennzoil vs 10,000 miles plus Amsoil).
The millage is close but appears to be a bit better with the Amsoil at  24.6-25.7 mpg vs 23.6-24.7 mpg for Pennzoil.
I will add more information to this review as I add more mile to the engine with the Pennzoil.","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2016",,
