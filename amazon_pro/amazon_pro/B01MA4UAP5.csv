Test results show one of the best oils in the market!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bulgar,"Pennzoil Ultra Platinum scores very well in oil studies and tests, and for the price, you just can't beat it. The top three oils from the Project Farm test indicate Amsoil, Red Line, and Pennzoil Ultra Platinum. Pennzoil is a win for value as its much cheaper, Amsoil costs about a $100 for 6 quarts, and Red Line is somewhere around the $80s. This is around $50 and scores just as well as the other two.","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2023",,
OEM FAV,5.0 out of 5 stars,B,"Oh, look at this fancy motor oil! It's made from natural gas with some patented magic tech stuff. They claim it's next level performance, like I'm driving a race car on my way to work! And hey, it's carbon neutral too, so I'm saving the planet one oil change at a time. I wonder if my car will go vroom vroom faster with this Pennzoil Ultra Platinum. Plus, it's the only oil that's good enough for my SRT HEMI engines. My car's gonna feel so special with this oil in its belly!","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023",,
"Good oil, om the pricey side",5.0 out of 5 stars,ckleinfeld,"This oil has a good additive profile and continually receives praise from folks well versed in oil technology.

Works with my 2019 Outback,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reid Family,"My 2019 Outback consumes a bit of oil between oil changes, so I always keep a couple quarts in the hatch. This synthetic oil is exactly what I need. No complaints with this oil.","Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2023",,
Great for my hyundias,5.0 out of 5 stars,OK chief,"I use pz 5w30 for my 2017 1.6T tucson limited (4.5qts) and pz 5w20 for my 2.0 elantra limited (4.2qts). I change every 5k on the dot. Save your leftover new oil into it's own jug, at some point you'll get an extra OC. Check your capacity simple google search. It's unwise to just blindly dump the full 5qts without knowing your recommended capacity. It's typically advised to run less than more oil in general.
I wouldn't go 100k, even over 10k, without an oil change I don't care what the manufacturers claim lol. Buy your bulk filters on Amazon as well. Don't forget to replace your crush washer. I got a magnetic fill bolt to monitor any internal wear just a suggestion. Overall very pleased at performance and price, can always count on this.
Dealers charge upwards of 100$+ for an oil change these days and you never know what they use or how much.. Good thing to learn to do for yourself and peace of mind.","Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2023",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Cw6kKXWrL._SY88.jpg,

Aimsoil without the aimsoil price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Florida Cracker,Great oil.  Pennzoil has various products in their line.  Be sure to get the Ultra platinum.  See reviews by project farm.

Best oil and Amazon is the best place to buy it,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brian M.,"I use this in my Highlander since it the most highly rated oil that's not outrageously priced (based on Project Farm testing). But it is hard to find at retail and even auto stores, especially for a reasonable price. The three pack from Amazon is, by far, the best deal I have found on it so will continue to buy it here.","Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2023",,
