2nd time is a charm,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just Me,"I purchased this for a DIY oil change on my wife's Infiniti QX30 (power train sourced from Mercedes).  Doing it myself, I saved about $70 over the dealership's advertised synthetic oil change.  I actually enjoy this type of maintenance work, and I get to pick the parts and fluids used.  And I like Pennzoil synthetics better than several other domestic brands.
However, the package as received showed that there was oil leaking from one or more bottles.  Amazon had kept the oil in the original Pennzoil case, so Amazon was not to blame for the leakage.  I immediately opened the case and cleaned and inspected each quart.  Several had caps that were not on tight!  I think that overall more than 1/8 of a quart had leaked.  I'm glad I was home when the package was delivered, otherwise I would have had an oil stain on my front porch concrete floor.  Now that would have really p...ed me off!  So Pennzoil needs to better seal their quart bottles (QA issue?) and Amazon should check for this type of issue (it was obvious on the outer Amazon box) and not deliver when there are signs of leakage.
Update - 8/11/23  Purchased a second time for my annual oil change on the QX30.  This time the case was delivered without leakage.  Buying from Amazon is a big time saver, as the Euro LX 0W30 is difficult to find at retail.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2022",,

"Quick shipping, product was as advertised",5.0 out of 5 stars,Ryan M.,"I’ve been a fan of Pennzoil products so rating the product itself was a no-brainer. With Amazon being such a big marketplace for third parties to sell products, I was nervous buying something that wasn’t sold directly from Amazon.
I inspected the packaging and looks like the package arrived intact and product arrived as advertised. The bottles of oil weren’t even taken out of the original Pennzoil box, it was just packaged as such. I do want to make one recommendation (if the seller sees this), please pack the box with some packing materials so the likelihood of the quarts of oil getting damaged is reduced.
Overall, can’t really complain. Shipping was fast, and the product arrived as it was advertised.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2022",,
