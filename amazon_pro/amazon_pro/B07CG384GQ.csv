Great oil at an even better price,5.0 out of 5 stars,Justin m.,"After watching a comparison video on YouTube by projectfarm( I highly recommend his review videos) I was very impressed with amazon basics oil performance. I care a lot about my vehicles and take care of them however before I start using this oil in my ram r/t or my wife’s charger r/t(always used Mobil 1 synthetic) I wanted to see the performance of this oil first hand. While doing the spring maintenance on my lawnmower, pressure washer and sons go kart I decided to give this oil a try. Just FYI my lawnmower was purchased new by my father in 1995 and is all original except for a starter replacement around 2007 I would say how many hours are on it but there is no hour meter(guesstimating around 900-1000 hours), pressure washer is of similar age but only used 2-3 times per year and the go kart is in the condition any 5-9 year old would keep it and is around 7 years old. The lawnmower runs like brand new! It used to smoke pretty bad on startup but so far 4 uses this year and no smoke(I did go with a thicker weight 10-40 vs 10-30 as used in the past). I’m still a few thousand miles from my next vehicle oil changes but so far amazon basics has won me over.

Alternatively, I have used the

When I saw that AmazonBasics came out with an equivalent, I was excited to give it a try. I did some research and found that this oil has all of the approvals (dexos1 Gen 2, API SN, ILSAC GF-5, etc.) that you would expect from a full-synthetic motor oil.
So far I have used this oil for two changes on my 2013 Subaru Forester. That vehicle takes just over 5 qt. of motor oil, which makes life really simple! All I do is empty the entire 5 qt. container in through the 
 and then check the level after driving off the ramps. If it is low, I crack into one of the single quart bottles. I have yet to notice any difference in driving, noise, power or fuel economy.

Great Value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Chris Uehlein,"I normally use Mobil 1 full synthetic 5W 20 in my car. After seeing a review on youtube about this oil, I figured I would try it myself. Every other oil change, I send a sample to Blackstone-Labs in Ft. Wayne, IN for an analysis.  The Mobile 1 with a Mobil 1 filter always comes back with a great analysis report.  I did an oil change with Amazon Basics full synthetic and a Mobil 1 filter and sent an oil sample to Blackstone-Labs. Same thing, great report except a trace amount of fuel in the oil. This could be because of excessive idle time and has nothing to do with the Amazon Basics oil. I don't change my oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles either. I go by when the computer on the car  tells me it's time to change the oil or when I get down to 3% oil life remaining. I put 9,868 miles on the Amazon Basics oil and it was still good. Todays oils are so much better than they were just a few years ago. The only way to tell if the oil you are using is good or bad is by doing an oil analysis. This will also let you know more about what is going on inside your engine, like, a leaky fuel injector(s) , antifreeze in your coolant, cylinder and bearing wear, viscosity, and if the filter you are using is working properly.

Well if this wasn't oil I'd probably not have purchased it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rob Jackson,"I see you've stumbled upon Amazon basics oil, well let me tell you a thing or two. First of all, this is infact a petroleum product. You may be surprised by that, rightfully so as I myself could not believe that what I had purchased was indeed made by hundreds of years of compressed plant and Dino goop. By Dino, I am in fact referring to the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 million years ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch. As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago.

My husband mentioned this oil, and I read the reviews and watched videos and thought ok- let’s try it. It works really well. I’ve never had any issues with it and it costs a lot less than the other brands. I feel like it works better than most brands. We’re really happy with it. Best thing is you can have this as a subscription so there’s no excuse to forget because they ship it straight to your house as often as you need it. We have it set every 3-4 months, but you can adjust it how you personally need it. Very helpful. Ours came with the see-through line on the side so we can see how much we’re using because our van takes 5.9 quarts.

For this price of the Amazon 5w/30 full synthetic and the good reviews I decided to give it a shot. First off my Bronco is not a mpg champ. Quite the opposite at around 10 to 11 mpg in town and 12.5 to 13.5 highway. I had 2 things I wanted to see with this change. Did I get better mpg and would this full synthetic cause leaks. I did not notice a difference in mpg. Didn't expect I would. Did it leak? No. Of note is that I never have had to add oil during my 4,000 mile oil changes but will occasionally get a drip or two on my garage floor. I put a piece of cardboard where I park it to see possible leakage but none. This is after about 900 miles and hunting on forest roads and trails.

I use my Camry to commute 110 miles round trip to work, so I do change the oil and filter about every 2 1/2 months. My Camry has 110,000 miles now (I bought it one year ago with 70,000 miles) and it drives great!  No issues at all. The engine does not use, leak, or burn this synthetic oil.
I buy this online for convenience. Walmart has the same oil in their SuperTech brand. Both made by Warren Distribution, but selling for less money than Amazon now sells it for. Even more so now since Amazon raised the price recently. I buy from Amazon party due to convenience, but mostly because my local Walmart store is now always out of stock!
Amazon oil is certainly not as good as Amsoil, but plenty good enough for an old car that gets regular oil changes every 5,000 miles. (My good cars get Amsoil in everything from differentials, transmissions, transfer cases, U-Joints, and engines).

Excellent!  Highly recommend!,5.0 out of 5 stars,IronBeard,"I have regularly used Full Synthetic oils for awhile now.  I was hesitant to switch from Mobil1, so I searched on some reviews and tests done on this oil.  Everything looked good, so I moved forward.  Here are a few reviews and tests:  Project Farm https://youtu.be/a9DWGtXpYUc  and  Scotty Kilmer  https://youtu.be/Ye-5EyrwkOQ  The API ""donut"" shows it has been thoroughly tested in ways that neither of these two are able to do and passed.
I have now been using this oil for over a year.  I use 5w30 in my 2007 Land Cruiser (4.7 L v8), my 2011 Ford E250 EXT (5.4 L v8), and my mom's 2008 Lexus GX 470 (4.7 L v8).  I use the 0w20 in my daughter's 2009 Camry Hybrid (2.4 L 4cyl hybrid).  I change the oil and filter ~every 5000 miles (yes, I know you are supposed to be able to go 7000 miles... I'm just can't bring myself to do that.  I was a stickler for 3000 mile oil changes with conventional.)  The oil goes in clean and comes out dirty, just like it should.  I have never found any filings or metal flakes - or any other indicators of excessive wear.  It is REALLY hard to beat the price on this, and I am well pleased with the way it operates.  I do not plan to change anytime soon.  BTW, you should search for some testing on YouTube for oil filters, as well.  Wix, Napa (made by Wix), and Toyota seem to me to be top notch.

ILSAC standards are constantly evolving and improving to meet changing industry demands. The popularization of turbocharged engines among Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) has led to a new focus on turbocharger-specific standards for GF-6. The primary purpose of GF-6 is to combat problems with LSPI, a common issue with turbocharged engines. As in the 2018 upgrade of API SN to API SN Plus, the new ILSAC GF-6 standards also require added protection against the harmful effects of LSPI in today’s modern turbocharged engines.","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2023",,

Works well in a Lexus GX470,5.0 out of 5 stars,RooRoo,"I finally started changing my own oil in our vehicles.  We have a 2008 Lexus GX470.  I put the full synthetic in a few thousand miles ago and so far it has worked great.  I’ll be doing an oil test to make sure everything is working well, but I have no reason to believe it won’t be just as good as the more expensive oil.  I actually plan on putting this in my Land Cruiser as well when it is due for an oil change.","Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2023",,
Engine hasn't blown up,4.0 out of 5 stars,William Z.,"I used this stuff, engine still runs.  Actually I've decided that this oil is actually pretty good after watching Project Farm on Youtube test it.  One star knocked off because my engine still burns oil excessively.

This oil has survived multiple track sessions at 283 degrees F,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,"When priced around $30 for 6 quarts of 5W-40, this was easily the best oil for the money, even in a car (VW Golf) that sees significant track use.

The oil is a 5 star product.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Chris L.,"I would give the oil itself 5 stars. But it seems like they are always back ordered now. It takes 2-3 weeks for me to get this oil and will be the reason I don’t buy it next time. It is great oil, there’s no doubt about that. If you have time to wait on shipping I would buy this oil over any other for the price and quality.","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022",,

It's good oil,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mr Huskey,"My zero turn mower leaks oil like crazy.  The lawn mower repair guy said the upper seal was bad, but he can't replace it until this fall.  I just have to settle with adding a quart of oil after every 2 hours or so of running time.  I could buy similar oil for about $7 cheaper locally, but without a vehicle it sure is convenient just having oil delivered to my home.  I probably would not buy this oil if I had a way into town a bit more often.  If the mower didn't leak, I would probably also spend a little more and get a synthetic oil for my zero turn.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020",,
"Good oil, bad bottle design.",3.0 out of 5 stars,David,"I watched quite a few videos on the oil before purchasing. For the money it seems to be really good oil. Here is the big (but easily fixed problem if you are listening Amazon) problem, the bottles have no sight glass on the the bottle like pretty much every other manufacturer has. My truck takes 7-7.5 qts of oil. I bought 2 5 qt bottles. In the past, I dump the entire 5 qts in then add a little front the 2nd large bottle and see how much I added through the sight glass on the bottle. This keeps me from over filling and being forced to drain abd waist new oil. Would make the product that much better if I could see on the bottle how much I am adding.","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2019",,
Not great for my Hyundai.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Steven,"Note: This review is actually for the Amazon Essentials Conventional 5w-30, NOT the full synthetic 0w-20 (which I bought at the same time for my wife's Camry).
2014 Hyundai Elantra.  I typically use Pennzoil 5w-30 dino with a Hyundai filter.  I didn't see any on sale when I went to do my change a couple weeks ago, so tried out the Amazon oil.
I won't be buying it again.  The engine is significantly louder, rougher, and vibrates more than with Pennzoil.  My gas mileage has also gone down by 3-4mpg on the highway.
I don't know if this will work fine in our cars, and I'm not worried my car will be destroyed by this one change, but I'll be sticking with Pennzoil from now on.","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2018",,

Add the clear strip to the bottle and we got a winner,3.0 out of 5 stars,Shamwow,"
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 As you can see in the video and the pictures I attached the bottle has its flaw where there is no clear strip like other name brand bottles to see the level oil you have. Unless your vehicle takes 5 quarts then you got an easy job but if it takes like 4.2 you'll have to either measure to be safe or just eye it like I did. I'll see how my cars hold up running this brand oil but don't foresee any issues happening.","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2018","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610wBsOWMcL._SY88.jpg

First impression matters,3.0 out of 5 stars,David Pineda,The oil is amazing for it price and there is really no difference between brands and how it made BUT my problem for first time buying it. I wish it was package better one of the bottles were open and spilled oil all over the box it not too serious that I lost a lot of oil but still left a good mess all over. The bottles also feel really cheap and it looks like it can break open any time but at least the oil is good. I also wish amazon will give you the option to buy a single bottle.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2019",,
Why did the price go up?,3.0 out of 5 stars,M3rKn,"Mileage is subjective. Longevity... all cars burn oil, just depends on your car, but this will last about the same amount as Mobil 1 before I have to add any.
I've been using this in my daily driver for about a year now, but now its the same price as a 5qt of Mobil 1 full synthetic. At 19 bucks for 5 quarts when my car needs 6.5 made a lot of sense, but with the price hike why buy this when I can get a top brand at Walmart for the same price?","Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2019",,
Not a value any more,3.0 out of 5 stars,_Beck,"The oil is great and I'd rank it up there with the brand names.  When I started buying it, the 6 qts were only $21 and the 5 qt jug was $19. Great value at the time. However with the 5 qt jug being $27 now, buying it is not worth it. Walmart sells a 5 qt. Jug of Mobil 1 for $24.","Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2020",,
"Oil OK, but some leakag",3.0 out of 5 stars,CR,"The box arrived with an oil stain. WHen I opened it, there was some oil on two/three of the bottles.

"Good price, not sure if its worth it...",3.0 out of 5 stars,Javier,"I really wanted to like the idea of Amazon offering full synthetic oil at a decent price. Sadly either it didn't fit the bill, or my 2010 Chevy Malibu just didn't like it. Right after the oil change I experienced a slight dry start like noise in the cold mornings, and even after warm up and pressure build up it just felt like the engine was forcing itself. Ended up getting some premium oil and new filter and now the car runs smooth.","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2018",,
Oil is okay,2.0 out of 5 stars,Fernando Castillo,"The oil itself works as intended, just sad that it showed up in a beat up oily box. ONE of the bottles leaked on the other ones.

Not sure how it's different than other oils for low-mileage?,2.0 out of 5 stars,Maria,"I got this after a friend recommended it. I took it to my mechanic and he said it didn't seem as thick as other high-mileage ones he had used. A couple of months later, I had to replace my oil again even though I was 4000 miles away from having to (the oil kept leaking). I don't think it's built for low mileage to be honest. I used another high-mileage from AutoZone and that worked perfectly, and I noticed my car driving smoother than with this Amazon one.","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2019",,
