2016 Mazda CX-5 going on 120k miles without issue.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pat,"I get the cheapest synthetic 0w-20 oil I can find for my 2016 Mazda CX-5 and the Amazon synthetic is usually the cheapest. My CX-5 is running great after 115k miles and I don't drive it easy. I let my kid do the little automatic shifter and we use Sport mode often revving it up and keeping life interesting. The engine runs great and I wouldn't hesitate to use Amazon synthetic oil in any car. After all, it meets the same standards as any other oil for a conventional car.","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",,

Works As Intended,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gad-G Guy,"I’m no mechanic. This is a typical engine oil. I’ve used this before, and I don’t notice anything wrong with the car. I guess it works fine. This one in particular is for 2016 Lexus CT 200h. When I drained the last batch of oil after 5,000 miles of use, the color of the oil is still brown. Not as bad as I would think. I’ve seen old oil came out of this car at about the same mileage, and it was almost black. I think that was Pennzoil.","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2023",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pppdOcexL._SY88.jpg,
