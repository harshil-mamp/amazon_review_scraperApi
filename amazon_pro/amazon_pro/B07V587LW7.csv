MS-12633 spec is worth using in a Hemi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Johnny,"The ""0"" part of 0w-40 gives it a low enough viscosity to get oil up to the cam and roller-lifter assembly, which is prone to under-lubrication in current-generation (apx '09-present) Hemis, and especially in ones that idle a lot.  MS-12633 is a ""Taxi-Specification"": meaning for vehicles that idle a lot.  Hemi's a great engine but it's picky about the oil it needs.  This is the right stuff at a good price.","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023",,
What a deal!  Cheapest I can find it,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mparker,I've running this in my hemi ram for 4 oil changes now. Ram says 5w20 but thats just the epa sticking their noses where they dont belong.  I do oil changes roughly every 4k. Also running a bottle of liqui-moly. Oil pressure never drops below 46psi and valvetrain is the quietest it's ever been. I have MDS disabled and no engine light.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2023",,
Just want I needed for a great price,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ronald,I purchased a similar pack that came  with a oil filter for $31 more then this package. I definitely recommend this package better. Cheaper for the same oil and I can go to my local auto supply store and pick up a filter for half the price. It's hard to find this oil anywhere in store and penzoil is my go to. My only grip would be it takes about a week or so to arrive. Other then that its good,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2022",,
"2nd purchase, more to come",5.0 out of 5 stars,David C,"This is my plug for the oilüõ¢Ô∏è. I got a scat pack charger and jiffy lube stay outta the oil I need, this is the sponsored oil so along with the HO racing frame filter it's a win/win. Tried the molar, SRT filter jiffy lube but Nothing like the hp fram racing filter.","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2023",,
Just what my SRT392 needs!! Priced...okay.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Greener,"This is the factory recommended oil for my SRT392, and all 6.4L Hemi engines.  Price is high compared to any other penzoil oil, but its most likely a less used oil viscosity.  Don't get the purple stuff or the amsoil stuff.... you'll regret it if you drive your beast hard.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2022",,
