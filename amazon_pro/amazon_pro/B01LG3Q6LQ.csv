2001 Ford F-250 7.3L 4 door 4x4.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jim,"Been using this oil for about 5 years now in my truck.  I still change my oil every 3k so I'm really not putting this stuff to the test all that much but I've been happy with it.  I used to run the motorcraft 15w40 and after I switch to this I really didn't see too much of a change.  Starts up a little faster in the winter maybe but my truck has never had issues with colds starts either way.  I'm running a GTP38R turbo with some DP-tunes and a host of other small mods.  Still have stock fuel injectors for now, though so nothing is turned up too high.  I've read where some folks swear that this oil causes leaks but I never have had any issues with that at all.  I know sometimes a thinner synthetic will make leaks a little more noticable but that's not the oils fault.  All and all I like it and will keep using it.  A higher quality oil might be better if you're really trying to push those oil changes to 15k+ but I'd rather just run keep me oil fresh and clean.  Also, I've tried must overy oil filter out there and have settled on the Wix-XP.  seems to work good with this oil.

Great stuff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jacob,"I have a 2014 yz450f dirtbike that I have been using this oil in for 5 hours, give or take. Blown head gasket had coolant getting into my oil for all of those hours before fixing it, changing oil every time I parked my bike, milky white color every time, but no noticeable damage or rust and it held up great. Nothing bad to say about it. Cheaper than the recommended Yamalube for my bike so I am getting into the habit of changing oil after every ride or 3-5 hours. It has the Jaso certification and can be used for wet-clutch applications (doesn’t have anti-friction additives), so it is great for my bike. I won’t say it’s better than Yamalube, but at the right weight, it will do just as good as other oils in terms of lubrication and such, but may get worn out faster in the transmission, as the transmission shares oil with the clutch & crankcase, so I change it very often so the cheaper price is perfect.","Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020",,

Motorcycles Love this Oil~!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Farrok,"This oil is great.  I use in my Honda 250L and it works fine.
1. It's less expensive than other top motorcycle oils. You can change the oil every 1.200 miles and not go bankrupt.
2. It meets the Motorcycle oil standards and for wet plate clutch use.
3. You can find it when you need it; sometimes you can't find strictly Motorcycle Oils when traveling in remote areas of the country.
4. Do to its reasonable cost you will change the oil on schedule. No more just a few hundred miles on the oil more to save money.
5. The engine starts easy when it's cold.
6. The engine runs very smooth at highway speeds and with less vibration (I don't know why) It just does.
7. You can buy a 3 gallon carton from Amazon for $70 dollars when the same amount of top motorcycle oil would cost you $120+ dollars.
8. It's fully synthetic oil. Why buy mineral oil when you can buy this for almost the same cost?
9. It a bargain.
10. Many Motorcyclists swear by this oil.
11. Motorcycle transmissions are much smoother with this oil. No more ""Clunks"" when shifting.
Negatives:
1. The engine will not rap up quite as fast with this oil, but a much smoother wrap up.
2. The overall performance is just slightly under the finest Motorcycle oils which cost $60 dollars a gallon.
3. If you are a racer buy the expensive motorcycle oil. If you are a ordinary rider this oil is perfect, inexpensive and available.
4. The best motorcycle oil is worthless if you can't get it.

My side-by-side is primarily used on the street as my daily driver to and from work and when I had a 10,000 mile check at the dealership they mentioned that my clutches and belt was in great shape.
It is a little more expensive than I remember it being but back when I had a diesel truck I just added the extra gallon into the price of its oil change and with the cost of filters and everything else it didn't phase me. Now that I buy it exclusively for the side-by-side I realize how much it costs. However, if you compare this to the cost of an oil change with bottles labeled Kawasaki this is cheap!

Just to repeat what a lot of people know (and DON'T know) about this oil; its actually JASO DH-2 & MA/MA2 approved and has the stamp on the bottle to indicate it’s for motorcycle use. That means it’s safe for dry and wet clutch applications.
Here's the current properties per Shell at the date of my original post for nerds like me:
>ROTELLA T6 5W-40
Kinematic Viscosity @ 40C mm2/s ASTM D445 90
Kinematic Viscosity @ 100C mm2/s ASTM D445 14.9
Dynamic Viscosity  @ -30C mPa s ASTM D5293 6300
Total Base Number (TBN)  [ mg KOH/g ASTM D2896] 10.2
Sulfated Ash %  ASTM D874 1.0
Density @150C kg/l  ASTM D4052 0.846
Flash Point (COC) 0C ASTM D92 233
Pour Point 0C ASTM D97 -51
...And if you dig around T6 5w-40 is Volvo VDS-4 certified. So while Shell does not officially publish this, it must have a HTHS viscosity (Greater than) >3.9cP to meet this spec.
—— 1 Year update ——-
One year and (2) T6 changes later; the bike has never run as well or shifted as smooth. All winter and into the spring/summer (very mild a swing of only 40F to 80F ambient) my bike is never reluctant to upshift or downshift as it should, even cold. After 3k miles of brisk commuting everything felt great just before changing out the oil.

"Calling all Saab, Subaru, and other high turbo/rugged cars!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazonian,"This is the BEST oil you can get stateside for Saabs, Subarus, along with other forced induction cars.  Its marketed as a ""HEAVY DUTY DIESEL OIL"" but... dont be alarmed folks, this merely applies to the ADDITIVE PACKAGES that are added into this motor oil. Diesel engines generally require much higher lubricity and wear protection vs standard gasoline engines (glow plugs, carbon soot, etc) BUT this oil works wonders on our turbocharged cars.
Dont be worried about the 5W-40 oil grade designation as the oil behaves more like a ""0-weight"" oil (such as the factory specs of my Saab and other newer turbocharged cars calling for Mobil 1 0W-30 or 0W-40). I believe the call for Mobil 1 0W-30/40 oils are pure AUTOMOTIVE POLITICS due to GM destroying Saab and leaving loyal enthusiasts with a sad turn of events since the recession. Long story short, u wont find other 5W-40 oils stateside as its uncommon but has a broader range of applications across a WIDE VARIETY OF CONDITIONS (extreme cold, heat, etc).
I have a Stg 3 Saab 9-3 2.0T Aero and only use this oil for my oil changes. Normally I'm the type to follow the owners manual to the point but on the forum known as Bob is the oil guy aka  ""BITOG"" (only source of diehard motor oil enthusiasts who actually perform tests between various oils and even offer oil analysis results (such as from Blackstone Labs), Shell Rotella T6, Techron, and MMO all receive high remarks and ratings. Surely these brands are doing something right if results can be tested for the truth.
Conclusion: if you wanna prolong your special turbocharged cars and minimize future engine problems: A bottle of Shell Rotella in your crankcase with a bottle of Techron Fuel System cleaner will keep that pesky overcharging mechanic away! Oh and if you're making more power with smoother engine operation then it merely shows your engine is HAPPY. Try out Shell Rotell folks. Only other oils I'd recommend is German Castrol aka GC which are special oils Made in Germany and are FAR SUPERIOR to the Castrol oils we get here (Ive confirmed the formulations differences with Castrol GMBH of Germany, its true).

Great for my 6.6 Duramax,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alpha_whiskey,"I have been in the market for some better synthetic oil, and I have had Rotella recommended to me a few times, and have read positive reviews in the past. I just upgraded my pickup to a Duramax and this engine oil fit the build for what I was looking for. So far, I have noticed a few good things. First, I seem to actually be getting higher gas mileage. I mainly drive highway, so my MPG is easy to keep track of. Overall, I have noticed a 3-5 MPG positive increase since I swapped out my old engine oil. Second, my turbo’s sound more quiet than before. Rotella claims to have a good effect on turbo performance and I can see that in real time. All in all, with the few things that I noticed immediately, I would recommend Rotella full synthetic to anyone looking to upgrade or look for an oil that may play a role in their engines longevity and performance.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2022",,
Powerstroke runs smoother,5.0 out of 5 stars,Justin Nobriga,"My 2004 f350 6.0 starts more easily and much quicker too! It runs smoother and sounds quieter. It’s a much happier engine on Rotella T6. I did switch from 15-40w to 5-40w because it’s colder here now in February.
Also, make sure and use the  Motorcraft 2016 filter too! These engines enjoy full synthetic oil and run best on Motorcraft parts. When you deviate from this game plan, they can become clackity clackity and noisy and don’t seem to turn over as quickly in the cold mornings.","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2023",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71swN6ztJZL._SY88.jpg,

Rotella T6 BLEW my 2011 STi turbo updated,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Amazing Hart,"2011 Stage 2 Sti. Cobb SF, downpipe, Grimmspeed TMIC, AOS with cusco catch can. DW 65 fuel pump, Apexi N1 Titanium exhaust.
I’ve been doing a lot of reading about the T6 been good for Subarus but I just wanted to issue a word of warning. I had less than 1000 miles on the Rotella oil change And one day out of nowhere I started noticing this burning suites think every time I went under boost. Then the next day I started noticing gray smoke coming out of my exhaust directly after boost. So obviously I’m freaking out do I have ring land failure or or my turbo seals shot?  So I freaked out put the stock TMIC and BOV back on. Even more smoke.....
Finally I’ve excepted the fact that something is very very bad in my engine and I start disassembling the car to put it back to complete stock.  Before I get to the downpipe I decide I’m going to go back and try some mobile1 5-30 because for one Rotella T6 will void your warranty. So I do the oil change with an OEM filter and buy some miraculous and thankful coincidence all the smoke and stink went away. First I tried economy mode map and it ran great so then I went back to stage 293 octane and easily pulled 17 pounds. No smoke no stank. When we change the oil it came out burnt beyond recognition had air bubbles in it and possibly water which made it lose all protection and bypass all my rings and blew back all the way through to the catalytic converter. Some people swear by this oil but I just want to put this out there to everyone to be very very careful because I almost lost my baby. So now I’m going to run the mobile one for a couple hundred miles and then switching over to Motul 8100 x clean.
I cannot figure out how on auto so good could burn out and lose all viscosity under 1000 miles to the point It could’ve killed my car. So now we’re going to have to go through with an inspection camera and a full compression leak test just to be safe.
So I’m closing my advice is to stick to what Subaru tells you to run And don’t take advice off the Internet

I would give this oil a 5 star review if only they would make it in a 5 quart jug versus the 1 gallon it comes in. It makes it difficult in most engines to get the amount right.","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2018",,

Unless and until Shell obtains API Gasoline engine certification, buyer beware using this new ""Diesel Only"" certified oil in your Motorcycles (old formula was both Diesel and Gasoline certified). A real shame and BIG loss to the Motorcycle community, Rotella T6 was the only reasonably priced full synthetic oil for Motorcycle use.
