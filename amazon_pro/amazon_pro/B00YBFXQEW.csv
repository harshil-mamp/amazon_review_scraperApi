Does the job,5.0 out of 5 stars,M&M,"Got this for my Onan 2500 propane generator on my rv. My generator is 9 years old with 35 hours on it. Previous owner barely used it. When I first ran it, it was slow to start and would stall out sometimes. Probably due to old oil and/or low oil. Either way, drained and filled with this and it fires right up. It does cost a little more for this, but this is what’s recommended for these generators and it’s not like you need to change it all the time. Either way, generator working great again. All I could ask for.","Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2023",,
