Spills,4.0 out of 5 stars,MrsC,Good oil however even with a funnel the oil spills down the side of the bottle. Ive never had that issue with regular shaped oil jugs.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2023",,
Great in 2005 Accord,5.0 out of 5 stars,K Bridgewater,"I have had my Accord since new so about 18 years now. I know it pretty well. It's getting up there in mileage so I gave this a try. I wasn't looking for a performance increase but I'm pleasantly surprised. I know it's easy to think placebo effect but before the oil change my car could just barely chirp the tires gunning it from a stand still. Now I can floor it and spin the tires. It feels stronger passing on the highway and it idles smoother. I went from the recommended 0w-20 to a 5w-30 so maybe that has something to do with the increase in power and smoothness. I'm going to just change at 5k. At this price, I'm fine with a shorter interval. Cheaper than another Accord and I think I can drive this thing until they outlaw gas.","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2023",,
"What, no damage?",5.0 out of 5 stars,filter fantom,The royal purple needs no comments fro me as it is established as one of the two or three best synthetics on the market.  What is surprising is the shipper padded the gallon container and enclosed the jug in a plastic bag sealed to ensure any leaks during shipping would be contained. Shocking. Happily there were no leaks. Good job guys for the protected shipping and careful packing.  Much better than I’ve seen from other suppliers.  Highly recommend this product and this supplier. Thanks,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2023",,

"Hello, it’s Royal purple",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,"Best oil you can use imho!! If you’ve ever taken the valve covers off after using Royal purple oil I don’t see how anyone could use a different oil. In my 50 years of using just about every oil on the market, Royal purple cleans the engine better than any oil I’ve ever seen. Once again this is just my .02…I","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2023",,
