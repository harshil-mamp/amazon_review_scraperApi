Same oil - Different label?,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ronald Mason,The oil that was advertised has a different label than the oil that arrived.  Same oil I guess and the numbers match.  Makes you think too much.  I like Mobil 1 products anyway.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2023",,
Extend Engine Life,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gregory Cinque,"I use the high mileage version of Mobil 1 in my Prius which has 115,000 miles on it and I still get 48mpg.  Oil demands on the Prius are demanding because of the constant on/off of the engine.  Need an oil that can withstand this kind of stress without gelling up and provide excellent lubrication without deposits.  When the Prius was new i used regular Mobil 1.  The car is a 2005.","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2021",,

It's Mobil 1. End of discussion.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bif McSeriousCat,"I'm not going to get into an argument about which oil is best, which additive package is best or conjecture about what it does to a given engine. It's Mobil1 synthetic for a specific purpose, if your car fits that niche, then go nuts. I alternate oil changes with this and Redline 10-30.
If you are a noob to oil, be assured this is good oil for your higher mileage car. Would you harm your car by using regular Mobil1 5-30? Of course not, this simply has a package that is designed to be beneficial for motors with a lot of miles.","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2015",,
Mobil 1 is excellent.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Santa Barbara, CA","Mobil 1 High Mileage is fantastic. My 2005 Toyota Tacoma with 245,000 miles runs and purrs like a well pet kitten. I am so pleased that I have used moblil 1 synthetic products throughout the entire life of this truck. Fantastic results on the life and quality of the engine. Just changed the oil a few days ago after 12,000 miles on previous service. Currently driving the interstates in the Western United States and the engine just glides up the mountains. A well maintained piece of equipment with QUALITY service and parts pays for itself and then some. This is an excellent synthetic. MOBIL 1  !!!","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2015",,

Reliable use.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Aaron,I have been using Mobil 1 on my 2003 Infiniti QX4 for ten years now and have no complaints. I have just recently switched to high mileage after it hit 80k +. It states synthetic is not recommended for this particular year and model but have been using it with no downsides and I do the majority of the work on my vehicle.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2016",,
