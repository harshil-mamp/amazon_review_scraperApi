The biggest plus is when you change the oil you can see how dirty it is, you oil should not come out clean or it is not doing it's job cleaning the engine.

I'd press the accelerator, and it would bog down, stutter, and nearly stall. This sounds like bad gas or a clogged fuel filter. It could even be dirty injectors or a computer problem. There are many potential causes. Bad oil does not sound possible, and the oil really wasn't ""bad"". However, I was due for an oil change anyway. Just to be safe, I decided to ""upgrade"" to the Castrol. Much to my amazement, the stuttering has not come back. The car runs great! I like that Castrol meets or exceeds the European Standards which are more stringent than the US. If it's good enough for European Luxury cars, it's certainly good enough for my Toyota. I'm pleased and will buy again and again. Mobile1 has so many mixed reviews. One professional review says Mobiel1 is the best, another says it's at the bottom of the list.

My 2017 Toyota Corolla loves this oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Frank A,"Newer Toyota's running synthetic oils are supposed to go 10K miles between oil changes per Toyota.  I still try to change it around 4-5K miles.  I have loved Castrol since the 80's and this is the first car that I have owned that needed a 0W20 synthetic oil.  This synthetic Edge oil is great... the engine is a bit quieter and the oil after 5K miles comes out of the engine like oil instead of water viscosity.
EDIT Dec 24, 2018: I found that Amsoil had a third party test a bunch of oil brands against their oil for TBN levels.  TBN is the total base number and a higher TBN number means it has greater abilities to combat the corrosive contamination that oil receives in the engine.  Castrol EDGE came in second place in that test beating my other favorite oil, Mobil 1.
Castrol EDGE beat all of the competition in TEOST scores.  TEOST sands for Thermo-oxidation Engine Oil Simulation Test… this test is a durability test under operating conditions.  Mobil 1 EP was next to last in this test.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2018","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HgydsA3uL._SY88.jpg

The best (so far),5.0 out of 5 stars,Esenbek,"Car: 2017 Nissan Rogue Sport
Required viscosity:  0W-20
Mileage: 7500 miles
First time I changed oil at around 3000 miles, I used Amazon Basics 0W-20 for $15 for 5qt with Nissan OEM oil filter.
Didn't really feel any difference nor improvement
At 7500 I decided to go with a bit better oil and found Castrol Edge 0W-20 for $28 with Bosch filter.. I always thought that oil is oil and should not matter what brand it is.. I was wrong...
I immediately felt the difference, with castrol my car starts faster, ride is smoother, quieter,  it even sounds better after 3000 rpms.
Don't try to save extra $10 and buy cheap product, even if it is from Amazon, reminder, Amazon doesn't produce anything, they are resellers and quality not always good.
Go with good brands, oil prices are higher nowadays and what more important - saved $10 or $300-$600 engine problems ? I'll be always using Castrol or other brands that actually do know how to make engine oil.

"Good, cheap 0W-20 oil",5.0 out of 5 stars,IndianaRunner,"I decided at some point in the past year that I was tired of having my Subaru Impreza's oil changed by the dealer. It happened sometime around the point when the dealer changed the oil, I drove the car 1000 miles, the ""low oil"" light came on, and then I took the car back to the dealer to basically figure out if they had a) either not fully loaded up the car with oil or b) the quality of the OEM oil that they were utilizing was so poor that the car was burning it off at an excessive rate. When the first words out of their mouth were ""we should do an oil consumption test"" on the car I had purchased from them no more than 3 months prior (with a head to toe pre-certified used car check), I vow that I would handle the oil changes on my own car, thank you very much, and see if I had any evidence of oil consumption problems.
I naturally reached for this oil first given the appealing price point. I can say the following pros and cons about this oil:
Pros:
- the cost is superb especially for 0W-20; it is also carried at Wal-Mart for a similar price but otherwise 0W-20 remains tough to find
- I change my oil every 5,000 miles with this as I have a long commute (1.5 hrs/day) at high speeds (~75 mph); I can tell when the oil is low and/or needing changing on my beloved Subaru and the 5,000 mile mark tends to be it. I don't mind given the price.
- despite my aggressive driving and my nasty commute, this oil holds up well with minimal loss over the course of one replacement. I usually will add a little bit of oil around the 3,000 mile mark but nothing out of the ordinary
- I like the fact that Wal Mart carries this even though I buy it from Amazon - I did have one instance where I added too little oil and could tell my Subaru was dragging a bit; I pulled over, picked up a quart from Wal Mart, topped it off, and went on my way with no problems
Cons:
- this is completely vain but it is tough to see the quantity of the oil that is left in the container in my dark garage; I have oil from another rival company of Castrol's and the lighter material for that company's oil makes it easier to measure the volume added to the engine
I am going to replace my oil with a more expensive product in the upcoming months and will update this review as needed if I find that the more expensive product is wildly better. My prediction is that this will perform very similarly at about half the cost.
Update after using more expensive oil:
- I purchased a more expensive 02-20 synthetic oil (approximately twice as much as this Castrol oil). I noticed no difference in terms of performance. Subarus tend to burn more oil than most vehicles, but I didn't notice a difference in how much oil the Subaru burned between this Castrol oil and the more expensive stuff. I have switched back to this oil permanently.","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2017",,

Castrol Edge in Honda,5.0 out of 5 stars,David Hadden,"This is the recommended brand for my Mini Cooper (5W-30). So, I decided to start using it in my 2018 Civic as well (0W-20). One thing that stood out to me was that the engine started running much smoother at idle. It wasn't a bad vibration, but it didn't seem normal for a newer vehicle. It had been doing it for a while, even after a fresh oil and air filter change, and new spark plugs. It was a noticeable difference. So, I'm glad I made the change. I'll update if there are any further positive results or any adverse results. My Mini Cooper runs great with 134k miles on the ticket, and I feel Castrol Edge plays a big role in that. I feel the Honda (42k miles) will benefit greatly from it as well.","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2022",,

Good Oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,woodworker,"Buy a good oil and change it regularly, a recipe for long engine life.  Our car is set to remind me when to change the oil, it varies by driving style but waits at least 10,000 miles.  I know people who change it much earlier than that, but I think I'll compromise on 7,500, as it looked pretty dirty at 10k. last oil change.","Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2023",,

Mazda 3 2.0 Skyactive,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ostik223,"I have been using this oil for almost a year now and have noticed a significant improvement in the overall performance of my vehicle.
The oil provides excellent lubrication, and I can feel a smoother ride when driving. The engine runs quietly and efficiently, and I have seen an improvement in fuel economy.
Furthermore, the oil has excellent resistance to wear and tear, and I have not experienced any issues with the engine or any other parts of my vehicle. The oil also keeps the engine clean, and I have noticed a significant reduction in sludge buildup.
Overall, I highly recommend the Castrol 03124 Edge 0W-20 Advanced Full Synthetic Motor Oil for anyone looking for a high-quality oil that will keep their engine running smoothly and efficiently. It's worth the investment and provides excellent value for money in the long run.","Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2023",,
Only oil I will use,5.0 out of 5 stars,Marie E.,"I've been using this oil every 4500 miles for the last 85,000 miles on my mazda 3 since new.  With other regular maintainence (air filter replacement, spark plugs, coolant flush) I can say my car performs like the day I bought it.  I still get 38mpg highway and burn zero oil.  This is the recommended oil for skyactiv engines and I wouldn't change a thing.  2017 2.5L 6Spd manual.  I use this oil with the mobil 1 extended life filter, and change the filter every oil change.  A few extra bucks on good maintainence will save thousands in the long run when you're burning oil, piston rings are worn out, making less power, and using more gas to compensate for the lack of power......as well as creating more air pollution.","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2023",,
