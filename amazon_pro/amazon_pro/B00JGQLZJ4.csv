Great engine protection,5.0 out of 5 stars,Irving C.,"I use this oil in my 2016 Subaru Forester limited. I also use a Purolator Boss oil filter, and a magnetic oil pan drain plug. I over maintain my car, so I do annual oil and all my filters by time rather than mileage ! I do this because I drive less than 5,000 miles a year and consider that harder service on my car. The drained oil comes out very clean, and with no debris. Good luck and be safe.","Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2023",,
