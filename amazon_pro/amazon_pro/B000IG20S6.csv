Cheap Insurance,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eric,Used 1 quart while changing the oil in my Audi A4 B9 engine.

You can feel the difference,5.0 out of 5 stars,LiuW,"I added it during an engine oil change and then I felt a difference, not only in smoothness, but also in increased mileage. Then, I added it to the engine oil when I added some extra engine oil.","Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2023",,

Good engine protection,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ralph,"This is an awesome product. You can see this oil stabilizer in display at any local auto parts store. I have been using this product for years and it has been great. My engine does not seem to feel any different. But that is a good thing. And it's still running strong at 172,000 miles. I will continue to buy this and use it in both my cars. I recommend you use this in your car if it's high mileage.","Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2023",,
great engine insurance,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mike Hughes,"been using this product (full synthetic) for years on all my drivers (4 vehicles) along with 0W-40 full synthetic oil and have never had any engine issue with over 600,000 total miles driven on these cars.  I do change my oil at less than 4000 mile intervals, and am careful not to run any of them hard when first started, and none of then tick, smoke, leak or make any expensive mechanical noises. I have also adapted to the crazy prices lately by buying this in gallon containers instead of quarts, which saves 7-8 dollars per quart.  highly recommend if you plan on taking your vehicle into the future.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2023",,
Does it Really do Everything They Say?,4.0 out of 5 stars,HSPS2,"Background:  I've been using the ""Lucas Heavy Duty Oil Stabilizer"" for a few years in my old, high mileage SUV which was used only occasionally for towing a boat and for winter storm driving.  It would often sit unused for a month at a time.  When started after a long period of no use, the engine would make a horrible, dry, grating, mechanical noise which I knew couldn't be a good thing.  So, based solely on manufacturer claims, I started using the heavy duty stabilizer.  Much to my pleasant surprise, the nasty gear/bearing noises totally disappeared immediately after my first use of the product and have never returned.
Currently:  I recently traded in the old SUV on a low mileage, gently used one of a different make. When reading up on my new SUV online, I found out that this particular motor has somewhat of a reputation for a rattling, dry mechanical noise upon cold startup which would last until the engine was warm.  It was a sound I heard immediately after the first cold start at home.  It wasn't nearly as bad as the sound from the old SUV, but it bothered me none the less.  I immediately thought of using the heavy duty oil stabilizer, however, my newer car requires much thinner 5-20W oil, and synthetic oil is highly recommended by the manufacturer.  So I bought the ""Synthetic Oil Stabilizer"" and did a complete oil/filter change and added one quart of the stabilizer.  The next day, the engine fired up and didn't even show a hint of the noise I had heard previously.  Still no noise 2000 miles later, even after a couple weeks of non-use at a time.
When I used the ""synthetic oil stabilizer"", I noticed it looks and feels totally different than the ""heavy duty"" stuff.  It's thinner, pours easier, and has a clearer, somewhat milky look to it.
But does it do EVERYTHING they claim it does?  Who knows.  But I do know that it eliminated my dry starts in the newer vehicle.  I've been tracking gas mileage and haven't really noticed much, if any, difference.  But I wouldn't expect much improvement on a type of car that doesn't get great mileage to begin with.
Why only 4 stars?  The only way to know if the stuff does EVERYTHING they claim, would be to track mileage over a long period of time, do a complete engine tear down, run dyno tests, and compare results with an identical vehicle which didn't get the same oil treatment.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any such tests/comparisons.  I think Lucas could do a much better job of proving their claims than they've done up to this point.  Until I see some kind of proof with a scientific comparison, or when I tear down my engine at 250,000 miles (which isn't going to happen), 4 stars is the best I can do.
However, as I stated, I know it works to eliminate my dry starts.  That's worth 4 stars for me.
I hope some of this is helpful to you.","Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2013",,
Reduces or Eliminates Dry Start Knocking and Helps Your Engine Last!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Marcus C. Hubbard,"My Nissan Altima had a dry start knocking (especially on cold days) this started before we hit 100k miles on the car. My wife had been taking the car to the dealer for regular oil changes. I wasn't changing the oil myself because we lived in an apartment at the time. I knew I need to do something different to make sure our engine lasted and I knew I couldn't ask someone else to add this addictive, so I started chaining the oil in the apartment complex parking lot using a qaurt of this (20%). It worked and this was a over 150K miles ago! The engine still runs well at over 250k! I expect to get another 100k or more our of the engine. I am confident that the problems would have progressed quickly had I not acted on this when I first started hearing the dry start knocking sound. I am grateful for this product and will always use it on all of my vehicles when changing the oil.","Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022",,
