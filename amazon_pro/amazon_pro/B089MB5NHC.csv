Exceptional Performance and Quality!,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ian Victorio,"I recently purchased the Motul 109776 8100 X-Cess Gen2 motor oil for my vehicle, and I couldn’t be more impressed with its performance. From the moment I started using it, I noticed a significant improvement in engine smoothness and overall power delivery. The Gen2 formula seems to have enhanced the oil’s capabilities, ensuring my engine runs cleaner and more efficiently than ever before.
What truly stands out to me is the noticeable reduction in engine noise and vibrations, making my daily commutes a much more pleasant experience. The oil’s superior lubrication properties undoubtedly contribute to the engine’s longevity, and I feel more confident in its ability to protect against wear and tear. Furthermore, the packaging and design of the product are user-friendly, making it easy to pour without any mess. Overall, the Motul 109776 8100 X-Cess Gen2 has exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it to fellow car enthusiasts looking for top-notch engine performance and protection.Just wish it came in more available

Awesome Oil!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Paul M,"I have been using this for my 2013 Porsche Panamera GTS as it's an approved oil for my car.
After each oil change, I have been getting an analysis done to ensure its holding up.
So far after each Oil Change of 10,000 Miles, it has had Perfect wear with potential to go further.
(10k is my personal limit)
I make sure to add a TBN test to ensure its holding up.
I was changing oil after 5k miles, but find I no longer need to as there is no benefit in doing so with this oil. Saves me money in the long run and still provides excellent protection.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2023",,

Great oil for built engines,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rod,"I’ve been running this oil since I had my iag built closed deck short block installed into my Subaru sti and haven’t had any issues with it. The engine runs great and you will get extended mileage before service when using this oil. I do run a bigger oil pan, currently using a killer b street series oil pan so I can use 6 liters of oil per oil change. With that being said I do check my oil weekly and do my oil changes every 5k miles and haven’t had any problem. I’ve been running this oil for over a year now and compared to other oils I’ve used I’ll be sticking with the motul oil for all my vehicles.","Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2022",,
