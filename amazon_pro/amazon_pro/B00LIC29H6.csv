No new car payment for me as long as this oil keeps doing its job...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mali,"I've been using this oil for a while now since switching from Mobil 1 and I can't say enough good things about it.  Mobil 1 is a great oil and frankly more readily available than this stuff and oh cheaper to-boot.  But for my ""baby"" nothing is too good.  I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised at how well Liqui Moly holds up after 6k miles.  Still golden color and minimal burn off / oil loss.  Maybe it's psychological but it feels like my engine runs happier, smoother and quieter with this product.  During my most recent oil change I also used Liqui Moly ProLine Engine Flush before draining the old oil and it was amazing to see the amount of sludge / deposits that were in the system even though I religiously change my oil every 5-6k miles though product is rated for 10k+ change intervals.  I also added Liqui Moly Createc friction reducer to the new oil.  Jury is still out as to the effect it will have but if my experience with the other products is any indicator I should be pleased with the results.
Now, I did my research before using these products and everyone out there has an opinion on everything from ""don't believe the hype"" to aspiring chemists who give you their take on the class / chemical make up of the base and product.  You'll go nuts reading and making sense of it all so my recommendation is go with your gut and choose the product that YOU feel works best...especially for your wallet.  You can't go wrong with Liqui Moly, Mobil 1 or any of the other FULL SYNTHETIC oils.  I did read however that in the US, oil manufacturers can call their product full synthetic is it has synthetic components whereas the products that originate from Europe / Germany must be 100% synthetic in order to carry the label.  Makes me even happier to be using Liqui Moly manufactured in Germany.  There are Liqui Moly products made in the USA so make sure the bottle says Made in Germany to be sure you are getting a Full Synthetic product.
Please note:  If you car is under manufacturer warranty though technically it cannot void the warranty even if dealer says otherwise, as a matter of personal preference I would only use the oil and not the additives like the flush or friction reducer.  No sense getting into a war of words with the dealer/manufacturer.  Since my car is a 2002 the only person I have to negotiate with is myself.","Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2017",,
"Great product and customer service, quick answers on emails",5.0 out of 5 stars,mike  lee,"First,1994 police caprice package 9C1  LT1, good condition, engine is more quiet, mileage increase was one to two MPG. The LT1 has a low idle oil pressure not a serious issue but engine idle oil pressure increased 7 psi at idle over other 5 weight oils. At five thousand miles on the oil since it was changed it still looks like it was just changed. I have always used premium API group for PAO oils , but the API is about as straight forward as  the The American Tobacco Institute in term of honest simple disclosures, The German ACEA rating is more honest very impressed with company, I have changed all of my vehicles to LM. Website and customer service is the best, email questions answered in less than 24 hours","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2022",,
