Hard to find in a box store,5.0 out of 5 stars,J. ONeal,"I used to purchase this from Wal-Mart before the pandemic, then all of a sudden it became impossible to find in any auto parts store.  After locating it on Amazon, I found the price went up $18.  Overall it's an excellent product but not sure how long I will keep using this brand especially since the price hike.","Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2023",,
Good Cost effective oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Michael,"The price is what i liked most for an engine oil formulated fir v twin motors with a wet clutch.

Works fine,4.0 out of 5 stars,ATI letdown,Decent oil depending on the price. Performs much like any other oil I have used. Most oils manufactured today are of good quality meeting established ratings JASO MA2 etc. with only subtle differences the average user really won't see. I ride my bikes like an average user so even conventional oils work fine be it with a slight reduction in longevity/shift feel.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2022",,

Perfect Amount for my V-Star 1300 Tourer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bob Patten,"Lot easier than pouring it in a quart at a time and close enough to capacity to just pour in the full gallon.
