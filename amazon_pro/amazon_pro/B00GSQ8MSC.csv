Only brand I use is Castrol GTX.,5.0 out of 5 stars,CJ C works in I.T.,"My father was a mechanic since he was a teenager (in his seventies now).  He's had more engines torn apart than I've had Reese's cups and at all different mileages.  He told me he's never had an oil-related problem be evident on any engine that has had Castrol GTX as its standard.  If you can get the conventional, it is one of the few made with mineral oil and not paraffin wax like a lot of other ""national"" brands are.  He says that makes a difference.  Now, I've only had a few engines apart, none of them more than once, so I can't speak to the same effect.  However, I can say that Castrol GTX is the only -- the ONLY -- brand oil I've used in any of the vehicles I've owned and I've never had a problem from the engines after taking ownership.  Our Chrysler 3.6L Pentastar had 30,000 miles on it when we got it and I've been less than strict on how frequently I've changed its oil (one time right after COVID we went about a year but only 7,000 miles), but it now has over 99,000 and is still going strong with no indication of oil or oil-related failure (coolant system and transmission are other stories).
I've also only ever used Castrol GTX in the Pontiac 2.2L Ecotec.  Same deal, drove it since nearly brand new (dealership handled the oil before I came into the picture).  Now has just under 80,000 on it, zero mechanical problems.  I'm not a GM guy but this has been a very good powertrain.
I feel bad taking the used oil to the local shop for disposal since I buy it online (meaning they're not making money on me), but nowhere brick-and-mortar has it at as low a price as Amazon (that I've seen, at least).  Plus, if they have Castrol, they don't have Purolator filters I use.  Odd, that.  Granted, I'm only saving about 5 or 6 dollars a jug, but being able to use the leftover on the next change, I just buy two or three at a time and store it until its time comes up.","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023",,
Good for higher-mileage Subaru Outback,4.0 out of 5 stars,AC,"I have an '05 Subaru Outback with about 200k miles on it, and do an oil/filter change about once every 5k miles. The Subaru boxer is well known for its appetite for fresh oil, so I try to keep it topped off. With the Castrol GTX High Mileage I find goes through about a quart every 1k miles or so, and by the time I hit 5k it's about ready to be swapped, though I can go a couple thousand more before it gets really dark.
I've been using it for five years or so and haven't had any issues whatsoever. Where I live we see temperatures from -15-105F, and the oil works just as well throughout the year. I've tried to use a couple other oils in the past and I'd say they performed no better at least than the Castrol, and not noticeably worse.
So, basically, if you want a decent, reliable oil, this will do fine.","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023",,
