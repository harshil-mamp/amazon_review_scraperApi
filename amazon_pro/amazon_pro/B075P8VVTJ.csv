If you Value your Vehicle‚Äôs Engine‚Ä¶,5.0 out of 5 stars,H. Lopez,"If you care anything for your car/truck/SUV/ or whatever you drive, you will supplement your engine oil with a quart of Lucas Oil. This stuff will make your car engine run smoother and give the maximum protection your engine deserves. I had a ‚Äò05 Chevy Cobalt that I used this in with every oil change religiously and it had over 240k miles and still didn‚Äôt burn a drop of oil and ran great. Gave the car to my in laws because they needed something with better fuel mileage and they love that car and it‚Äôs still running with over 250k miles!!! Stuff is legit!!!üòéüëçüèª","Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2023",,
This Stuff Works!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,GTO,"Used the whole bottle of the Lucas High Mileage Oil Stabilizer in my last oil change and within roughly 100 miles I noticed a difference. My Chevy V8 runs smoother, quieter, cold start is much better, got rid of the rough idle and definitely improved my oil consumption issue. I have driven about 3,000 miles since adding the Lucas High Mileage Oil Stabilizer and my ""Engine Oil Low"" light has still not come on. It used to come on at around 2,500 miles and I would need to add 1 quart of oil. Great product and I will definitely be adding the Lucas High Mileage Oil Stabilizer at every oil change.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023",,
Works great,5.0 out of 5 stars,Matt Hessen,As you would expect this stuff works!!! Had some light engine rattle and POOF! Not anymore. Suggestion: when you use this put it in first before the oil. Cut the bottom off and use it as a funnel. That way you get all the goodness without having to wait an hour for the bottle to drain.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2023",,
