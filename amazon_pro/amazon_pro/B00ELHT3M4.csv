"Royal Purple 5w-30, The LS3 Good Stuff",5.0 out of 5 stars,Customer,"PStunning did a great job getting me the Royal Purple 5w-30 in a timely manner. I would definitely buy from them in the future. The RP 5w-30 was quieter than the Mobil One 5w-30 that is spec'd out for my LS3 vehicle, the last time I used it. Quieter cold starts and quieter at running temperature. Thank you PStunning, Good job.","Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2023",,
I like it,5.0 out of 5 stars,luke,"Been my preferred oil since I got two vehicles that use the 5w30 viscosity. Makes the vehicles feel less lethargic, and seems like it gave me a smidge better mpg.","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2023",,
Excellent oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,John,"I use it in my 1973 Ford f250 360CI. Runs noticeably quieter and very smooth compared to your average conventional oil. I would say this is great stuff for older engines with flat-tappets. I messaged Royal Purple and asked what they recommended for an older car and this is the stuff. Lots of Zinc and Phosphorous/ZDDP substitute for the older technology. It also has an extremely high viscosity index, out of any oil I've seen, so you know it will perform great in those temp extremes as well, hot and cold. At about 11 bucks a quart if you buy in bulk, it's also hard to beat the price when comparing to Amsoil or Redline, although those would be great choices as well.
Comparing other options, Amsoil is a bit thinner than this and offers a little bit better cold weather performance and longevity, but is pretty expensive. Redline is nice because you know what they put in it, no secrets with them--very high quality group 5 ingredients. It's also the most robust, and probably offers the greatest protection in extreme operation. Don't necessarily know what they put in the HPS, though I imagine it's a high quality group 4/5 ester/PAO base, either that or its got a pretty beastly additive package to perform the way it does. Mobil is another obvious option and is probably the best all-rounder for your newer cars, though some of these ""boutique"" oils I've mentioned offer more specific things if you need them.
Overall, I think this one wins the comparison for price and if you don't change the oil every 20,000 miles. Personally, I wouldn't wait that long on any vehicle. Maybe 10,000 at the most in an engine that is perfectly sound.","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2022",,

Box looks used.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,The box used to ship items in had oil stains on it. We check the bottles and none of them were open or pierced.

Outstanding Performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,David,"While I’ll admit that it’s guesswork on how well a motor oil actually works until you disassemble the well used engine to inspect and measure wear on friction surfaces, I’ve never had an issue with Royal Purple HPS oil in my car, truck, boat or lawnmower.  I recently drove my Nissan Titan pickup cross country and back with a heavily loaded 20’ race car trailer and before I started I changed the oil with my usual combo, RP HPS and a Wix XP filter.  When the trip was over 6500 miles later, the oil still looked fairly clean which is amazing because I really pushed the motor hard over mountain passes and up long grades during the trip.  Whatever oil you choose, keep it clean and use a high quality filter.","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2022",,
Ended up upgrading from regular RP Full to HPS brand.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enigma Networks,"I am only buying this as a promise I made to my car, I refused the extended warranty I was pushed to get for additional 3k on top of the car price and said, for that 3k I can get BEST OIL, BEST ATF and filters and most importantly Premium Fuels.
I pay ten bucks for oil changes because I give them a WIX Filter and this oil.  Everyone takes 2nd look because they do notice I put premium parts and quality oil in the car.  From past experience adding cheap fuel 87, adding/changing of cheap oil at your lube place (which is recycled) I started having EGR issues, Catalytic Converter  issues, O2 sensors, Coils and won't even get into the cost of repair.  Most were due to using cheap fuel and one thing I learned is... It costs more money to be cheap vs paying for quality products.
For oil changes it saves me money, I no longer do it every 3k, I do it 5k or 6k or even more, I check filter and if needs I replace it @ 4k and let it go for further.  Oil is as new as it was put in the first day.
The cost is about the same for buying other brands.  I did notice going up in price and when it goes down in price again I'll order 2 (12q.) boxes.
Right now I am more curious how long the car will go using premium services/lube and fuel.  I always dump cars @ 160k miles and this I intended to keep till it falls apart.
I noticed that my car dropped from 22+ mpg to under 20 mpg in city.  Someone told me it is the WINTER gas and the additive all companies put in their gas during winter.  After I started pumping Premium gas one step from what I used to use (Plus'89) and dropped one of these in my tank, I got a little better mpg, my dash said 20-21.x from 19 but I'm still 1mpg lower than what I used to get last year.
The reason I put Premium fuel, premium Royal Purple HPS Oil and ATF is because I refused to pay an additional $3,000 for lame extended warranty at the dealer past the 36k miles, long story short, I ended up having existing power-train warranty from manuf. so by spending the 3k in premium insurance would have been a waste and abslt. dumb.  Keeping a car 5-8 years 200k should be no issue here, once you start with good quality parts and regular maintenance.","Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2014",,
