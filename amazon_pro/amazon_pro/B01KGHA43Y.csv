2017 toyota sienna valve lifter tick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shalva Javakhishvili,"I troed various products on my 2017 toyota sienna to quite my enine ticking sound and this one worked the best. I add one bottle on every oil change. I observed that for faster results you have to add ceratech in engine oil bottle, shake it and pour into an engine. Otherwise it takes a while to get mixed. That‚Äôs just how i do it.","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2023",,
Even helps with oil burn....somehow.,5.0 out of 5 stars,NOWORR,"I bought this product at the recommendation of an Audi dealer... The recommendation was the result of some unwanted engine noise (not the good kind).  The engine was fine, however, it had a notorious noise from the engine that seemed to be impacted by oil, meaning it was somehow friction related.  I had already gotten some improvement by upgrading my oil standards, and adding this to my oil changes at 15K, with a 3500 mile interval, fixed the rest.  In addition, Audi's are a bit notorious for oil burn - my vehicle was no different.  Unexpectedly, my oil burn stopped, engine temps dropped a bit and mileage improved (noticeably).  The product is no longer EU certified for warranty, meaning they are unable to void an engine warranty for using it... As the manufacturer of Ceratec told me, the formula is absolutely the same as when it WAS certified, but they decided to stop paying the EU the exorbitant annual testing fees for what amounted to self certification.  I mention this only because the product is safe for use, but I cannot guarantee that a vehicle manufacturer won't void your warranty.  I've used it for years, across 6 different cars and 3 different manufacturers without a single issue.  Warning: This will NOT extend the life of your oil in any way.","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023",,
Honda CR-V 40k miles and SLK 70k miles,4.0 out of 5 stars,ramm,"Update after 500miles on Honda CRV:
Not worried about the fuel efficiency, that's not the purpose of buying this. But fuel efficiency is an indicator of less friction and less wear. Definitely getting at least 1MPG higher, so at least that much frictional force is now avoided in the engine components. So, now I expect the Honda CRV 2017, known for oil dilution to last at least 100K miles. (40K now and 60K more to go).
So, planning to use this with every oil change but add only 50ml for 4 gallon oil, to be safe.
Pending Update on 3L naturally aspired R171.

Original Review:
I got that notorious Honda CR-V 1.5L Turbo, known for massive dilution with it GDI.  Will update the review with results if that's affecting, if there is anyone interested to know (give me a üëç so I know). I should know once I hit 2000miles, the Engine generally becomes ticky. Let me see how that helps.
Fill oil to a min level, then added this, ran engine for few mins, topped up oil to get the level close to Max. For now, as soon as I added this with new oil, of course there is a reduction in noise and less ticking. But I don't know yet if that's due to new oil or Ceratec magic. Will update after I clock 2k miles.
On my SLK300, 3L V6 naturally aspired engine, there is no noticeable change. I am expecting to see feedback via 0.5MPG increase, probably I should wait for 500miles at least, from what I read from the manufacturer.
The bottles had some dings on them, probably not due to Amazon logistics because the paper cover was intact. No issues though.","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2023","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71d2GVicm-L._SY88.jpg

Not snake oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Vogel Family,"I am skeptical about lots of engine oil additives.  However, LiquiMoly has surprised with some of their other products.  I added half a bottle to our 2016 Honda CRV while changing the oil and filter.  Didn‚Äôt notice anything when I took a test drive.  Next morning, I went to the CRV and started it up.  The CRV has always seemed a little rough for a few seconds after starting the engine.  This time that rough part was silky smooth.  I was still skeptical and thought maybe it was just the new oil.  My wife drives this car and puts on a lot of hard miles without any freeway driving.  So, a few months later, I got in the car when it was cold and started it up.  Once again, the startup was silky smooth.  Now I am sold.  I don‚Äôt expect to see dramatic differences in driving because I stay up to date on all maintenance.  However, if it can make that type of difference on startup with an engine that has 60k miles, it must be reducing friction.  They most wear happens on startup as well.  So, I just added half a bottle during the oil change to my 2013 Acura RDX with 85k miles.  We‚Äôll see how it does with that car.  We plan to keep these cars until the wheels fall off.  I will also be adding it to my son‚Äôs 2009 Toyota Tacoma TRD pro during the next oil change.","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2023",,
