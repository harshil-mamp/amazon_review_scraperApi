Not too many 20W-50 options out there,5.0 out of 5 stars,Marv,"Have to use this on my 2007 Rav4 for oil consumption. It's thick but it helps. Don't worry about it being a conventional oil, as long as you change it frequently it's good oil.","Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2023",,

Maybe just the thing for worn 4 stroke small engines!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alfonzo's Amazon prime directive,"I own a 2510 Kawasaki 4WD MULE with 1350 hard hours on it, over the last 18-20 years. Starts instantly, good compression, idles... but.. engine is getting a little “noisy”; Piston slap? Rod bearings?  I dunno. Still runs strong but time to pay closer attention. I used to run straight 10-40 in it but lately have been trying several different oils,  viscosities and synthetics.
I do think this 20-50 synthetic blend is what I have been looking for- Much quieter running after it warms up.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The manufacturer issued a lengthy caution which I fully considered- DO NOT use this oil in motorcycles or ATVs that have “wet clutches”. I get it. This oil may cause clutch slippage for reasons I totally understand.
That said, the MULE DOES NOT have a wet clutch. It has an external- torque converter with a belt. So clutch slippage isn’t a concern with this engine and drive. I also own a KAWA Prairie 650 4 Wheeler. Same external torque converter. I am putting this oil in my wheeler, next change.
FURTHER CONSIDERATION: This is heavy- thick oil which could cause starting problems in sub freezing temperatures, The MULE is in a building that is kept at minimum 35F. No problem. I also noted that when I shut the engine down then restarted it, it might take 30 seconds-to one minute for the low oil light to come on, on a restart. I consider this good. This means oil in the system remains under pressure for a minute or two after shut off.
I have other antique small engines  and am going to try this oil in them. If it works as good as I believe it will, it will go into all my small engines.
I’ve used Castrol oil on-off for decades. As good or better than any, Zero negatives. AMAZON is the only place I could find this 20-50 synth blend. Price is right for a gallon $5.00 quart. Beat that with a stick? I repair and keep all my small engines running. If this oil proves to be as good as I think it will be , I’m going to pass this along to my veteran small engine repair  pal who probably doesn’t know this exists. I think Castrol nailed it!","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019",,
