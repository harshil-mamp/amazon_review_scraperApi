"Long Review. Oil for street use, strip, and the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars,SSW,"Long Review. I hope that you take the time to read it.
I have always loved Pennzoil because growing up it was the oil of choice of successful top fuel funny car, top fuel dragster, alcohol dragster, alcohol funny car, and the Altered classes. Every successful winning sprint car I remember ran Pennzoil. Also this oil was a common sight for the mom and pop or hobbyist racers who were not supported by big names. I specifically remember when Pennzoil made the finest racing oil that sadly they have discounted production of. Their racing oil was the only one I can remember that said it was specifically formulated for use with methanol and nitromethane fuels. I can remember watching my father make a quarter mile pass and those win lights on both sides of the track were Pennzoil lights they were a beautiful sight at night I miss those. I loved using their racing oil I wish they would bring it back. This oil has proven itself over many years to be the best. You probably think I am paid or endorsed by Pennzoil I ain't. Speaking from my own personal experience with this oil in street, racing, and air cooled engine applications I can tell you it is excellent. I have sent this oil off for analysis by caterpillar diesel and it returned with much better numbers than the popular brand that rhymes with vaseline people find so amazing.  Look up the sheer numbers of this oil that will impress you. This oil has plenty of zinc along with the neccessary wear additives to protect older or even newer engines. This oil has always been made from the best bases and it has improved I think. Plus this oil supprts American jobs it is made right here in the USA.
If you think im full of nonsense contact the manufacturer they have always had the best technical support right here in the USA. They have answered many questions for me and I appreciate them they have saved me a lot of headaches
A few examples using this high mileage conventional oil.
One engine running this oil is 37 years old, all original, and high mileage, and no leaks. Had the original clutch and flywheel replaced at 137k. The mechanic who did the job said he was impressed my rear main seal was not seeping and looked perfectly fine. This 37 year old engine has had 10w-30 conventional Pennzoil used for every oil change at 3000 miles since it was bought from the dealership. Compression last tested it was just fine, oil pressure was fine, it doesn't consume/burn oil, it runs excellent, and it does not leak a drop of oil never has. When I did a valve adjustment on this engine everything was impressively clean no sludge or wax buidup. I plan to stick with this oil because I know it works in this engine.
This is my choice of oil in gasoline or propane burning air cooled single cylinder commercial equipment engines. Also commercial single or twin cylinder generator or portable welders that call for 10w-30 weight oil this is the best in my opinion. These engines get used hard, run long hours, operate in extreme conditions, operate in the worst environments, and need the best oil. I change the oil at the intervals that the manufacturer says and have absolutely no problems.
My other observation is that current gasoline is not what it used to be especially with the 10% ethanol. What I do on engines using this oil burning the current grades of trashy pump gasoline is change it on time at 3000 miles or at three months.
Engines I have disassembled for repair or rebuild that have used only conventional Pennzoil from day one that have been cared for by their owner I have never seen any ""sludge""or premature wear.  I can say I have honestly never seen any problems that were in any way oil related in an engine using the correct weight and designation of Pennzoil. Even engines that were used in harsh environments or engines ran hard this oil protected them perfectly. So these are other reason why I stick with this brand.
Keeping your oil and filter changed in all engines is just cheap insurance in my opinion. Every oil related failure I have ever seen was from not enough oil, wrong type or weight of oil, and people never changing it because they think they are smarter than an oil manufacturer who performs more testing than they can imagine. So if you believe all of these stupid oil conspiracy theories I honestly feel sorry for any respectful responsible mechanic you will have to deal with when you have a failure.
One pickup I had that under the hood was a 350 cubic inch V8 manufactured in 1976. This engine had nothing but conventional 10w-30 Pennzoil used in its engine at every 3000 mile  oil change by the first owner. This vehicle was bone stock with no modifications. It did a whole lot of towing and hauling never giving any problems. When I got this pickup it had an excess of over 300k plus miles on it still running strong. The engine only consumed a tiny bit of oil from wore valve guides and tired valve seals. This engine also did not leak or seep oil all gaskets were factory I ran the heck out of it and it probably had 400k plus miles on it. Just like the previous owner I used 10w-30 conventional Pennzoil in that engine and that engine lasted many miles.
Ideas and other thoughts
This oil will help the old seals stay pliable. If you don't believe me go buy some NOS 40 year old oil seals. Allow them soak a while in this high mileage 10w-30 oil.  I did this test myself and I was pleased to notice a difference so try it out it was a fun little experiment. If you see a seep or a little oil mist on a seal on your old engine try this oil you will notice an improvement. Also If your using synthetic and noticing a little oil seeping try this oil instead I honestly like it more than the synthetic.
By the way if you read the above I am not referring to a leaking bad wore out seal. Those leaks can only be fixed by replacement of the OEM seal or do yourself a favor buy an OEM equivalent gasket. I recommend the gasket brand old Smokey Yunick swears by in his Power Secrets. To sum it all up little common sense says no oil can fix a damaged or defective gasket, seal, or poorly maintained engine.
Closing thoughts :-)
 Get yourself a few big bottle of this great oil, buy some oil filters, get those kids away from those computers/phones, start that kid changing oil young. Together you and your kid changing the oil, oil filter, checking old oil in the drain pan for debris, teach proper safe handling of oil, disposing of oil properly, and importantly make some memories. I can remember handing my father Pennzoil in cans at the drag strip and in his garage. I can also remember that first time I changed oil with my father. So build some memories along with character with your oil change. I guarantee your kids will thank you when they are older and you will have some fun memories.  Doesn't have to be your kid it can be any kid by the way. Thank you so much for reading this review and I hope that it has helped you.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2022",,
Great Oil for a Great Price,5.0 out of 5 stars,Adam L.,"I have a small oil leak in my car and this is a necessity. I keep oil on hand at all times in case I need it. Oil performs well and have had no issues using in my car or changing the oil in one of our lawn mowers. If you need oil, I would suggest you get this. I have found it cheaper to even buy on Amazon then what I can find in stores. I haven't seen any performance issues in any oil change that I have done. I trust this oils protective quality 100%","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023",,
Great Product -- Delivered Leaking Though,5.0 out of 5 stars,Randall R. Scott,"I have used Pennzoil for decades with excellent results.  This is the first time I've ordered it from Amazon.  When I retrieved the package from my front door the next morning after delivery the evening before, the 5-quart container had leaked 1 quart through the box and onto my front porch.  They had sealed the top with extra tape, but it didn't help.","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",,
Hard to find in my area,5.0 out of 5 stars,Q,"I'm so glad I found this online. Pennzoil at that weight is perfect for my Subaru, but not the easiest to find in Florida. I'll definitely be buying more!","Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2023",,
Needs better packaging,4.0 out of 5 stars,danimal,"Amazon needs to tape the cap on these bottles.  One bottle of oil leaked a quart into the box, Amazon quickly sent me a replacement.  The caps on these bottles are small and cheap and dislodged during shipping, not unscrewed but slipped partially off.  Other oils I have received the caps were taped on to prevent leakage.","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023",,
