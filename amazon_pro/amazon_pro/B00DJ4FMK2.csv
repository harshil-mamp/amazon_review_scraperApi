The right oil for my 1954 Chevrolet pickup.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Walter L. Williams,"If you have a classic vehicle with a flat tappet lifter 6 cylinder, this the oil to use.  The ZDDP is the key.  Flat tappet lifter engines need the ZDDP, zinc additive to prevent excessive wear to the camshaft. My pickup is still going strong after 70,000 miles, religiously changing the oil every 3,000 miles. My pickup runs just as good now as when I first fired it up after rebuilding the engine. I won't use anything else.","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2023",,

Valvoline VR-1 Racing Oil for High Performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,RacerX,"Why: In an internal combustion engine the camshaft followers are one of the highest friction areas, which means you need to be concerned with proper lubrication to prevent excessive or premature wear. Most modern engines have benefited from racing engine technology and feature lower friction roller cam followers, but for older vehicles, muscle cars, and sports cars it is essential to have additives like Zinc that can handle high contact pressure, high friction components like flat tappet cams.
The problem: Once the major automakers began incorporating roller followers the need for these additives decreased and major oil companies began reducing them in their oil blends. Thus modern oils are inadequate for older design engines. Also, conventional oils are preferred over synthetic by many racing engine builders, and it has become difficult (or very expensive) to find refiners producing conventional oil in racing formulations.
The solution: Fortunately we have Valvoline; the only major brand that contains adequate amounts of Zinc additive for your vintage or high-performance engine. My experience using Valvoline 20W-50 Racing Oil in drag racing engines is that I've never had an oil related failure, and that piston rings, bearings, and cams show only expected wear.

ONE OF THE BEST OILS ON THE MARKET,5.0 out of 5 stars,astrorick55,"Valvoline's synthetic and non-synthetic racing oils are in the top 3-5 oils on the market. They certainly are the best value going! I've used both motor oils (20w/50 non-syn for break-in and syn for competition) for my 1967 BSA race bike and couldn't be happier. I've spent hours researching oils and they have among the best blend of zinc, phosphorus, ZDDP, base oils, and psi wear protection of any oil without having excess ZDDP that can cause corrosion and reduce engine longevity. No need for ZDDP additives with Valvoline's racing oils. They are the recommended oil of leading British motorcycle suppliers and are excellent for vintage engines with flat tappet cam protection. I was willing to spend whatever I needed for motor oil to protect my engine. But, it really isn't necessary to spend 2X - 4X more and still not get the same protection.

The oil weight/viscosity is as recommend by my mechanic who used to race my vehicle make/model when new. The only benefit I've noticed so far is that the vehicle seems to leak less. Since my car is running on the original motor, you have to take the approach that if it doesn't leak, it must not have oil in it. In this case, it seems to still leak (that's fine) but, I'm noticing less in the drip pan I leave under the car. More oil is cheaper than pulling the motor to replace the main rear seal. What I am most happy with is the cost of the oil and that when the oil occasionally burns out the tailpipe, it smells less funky than high mileage synthetics I've tried from others.","Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2022",,

Good choice for flat tappet pushrod engines,5.0 out of 5 stars,m6502,"The gray bottle VR1 conventional oil is essentially the same as Valvoline's mainstream ""premium conventional"" oil, but with much more ZDDP.  That seems to be the prevailing opinion on a forum dedicated just to motor oil, where many users send their oil in for a chemical analysis.
That's a good thing - it means this oil is perfectly safe to use in a street car for a normal length oil change interval, and Valvoline has said as much on the packaging.
ZDDP is a compound which contains phosphorus.  It's effective at points of high temperature and pressure, particularly the cam lobes and lifters.  However, if the oil is burned, phosphorus slowly degrades a catalytic converter.  Federal regulators now require the car manufacturer to warrant their catalytic converters for a very long time.  As far as I've been able to tell this isn't a real law, it's just the rising 4th branch of government making up new provisions to laws that were passed decades ago.
The end result is that manufacturers have influenced modern API standards to require reductions in the amount of phosphorus in the oil.  Modern engines don't require as much ZDDP anymore, but older flat tappet pushrod designs sometimes need more of it.
The phosphorus limits imposed by API do not apply to 20w50 grades.  Therefore, you'll find that the 20w50 version of this oil still has an API SN certification.  This 10w30 version does not have the API cert, simply because it violates the phosphorus limit which is applicable on 10w30.  It will still protect the engine as well as any SN rated oil would.
The 10w30 version used to claim that it ""meets or exceeds"" the API SH requirements, but after my last purchase (in 2015) I noticed this claim has been changed to API SG.  It's not an official certification, because you can't get API to certify standards that they consider obsolete, but the claim is an indication of where this oil sits in terms of it's ZDDP content.
Xw30 grade API SN oil (the current standard) cannot exceed 800ppm phosphorus.  The datasheet for VR1 10w30 says it contains 1300ppm phosphorus, zinc is 1400ppm.  Zinc and phosphorus track together because they're part of the same compound, but phosphorus is actually the part that's regulated and prevents it getting an API certification.
This amount of phosphorus was typical in the 80s and 90s, so it's not outrageous for an 80s car with a catalyst.  I figure that worst case, it just means the cat won't last any longer than it did in the 90s, and I'm okay with that.  The aftermarket replacement cats you'd probably have on an OBD-1 era car seem to break apart internally every 10 years anyway, regardless of oil.
You can also mix this oil with the common white bottle ""premium conventional"" I mentioned at the top, which has 760ppm phosphorus.  This will effectively dilute the ZDDP to something in between.
This oil is not recommended for new cars, which don't need it and their cats are much more expensive than on older cars.","Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2015",,

Used in a VR30DDTT 3.0 Pure Turbos Stage 2 engine with multiple mods,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gaming Guru,"I am running this oil for my Pure Turbos Stage 2 Infiniti Q50S so I have to run it. So far so good, oil temps are much lower than when running 0W 20 however Oil pressure even at idle is much higher. Obviously, this is a much thicker oil than the stock oil used in the car. I love the fact that is blue colored very cool, however, because I race my car I change the oil every 3000 miles or less sometimes 2000 miles. Very expensive hobby this whole racing car thing. It keeps the engine safe and keeps the heat down, especially under full boost.","Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2023",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61roAVHtwjL._SY88.jpg,

I cleaned it up the best I could - but there's was a lot already soaked in.","Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2021",,
