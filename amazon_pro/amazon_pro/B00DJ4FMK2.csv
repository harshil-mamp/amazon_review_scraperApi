The right oil for my 1954 Chevrolet pickup.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Walter L. Williams,"If you have a classic vehicle with a flat tappet lifter 6 cylinder, this the oil to use.  The ZDDP is the key.  Flat tappet lifter engines need the ZDDP, zinc additive to prevent excessive wear to the camshaft. My pickup is still going strong after 70,000 miles, religiously changing the oil every 3,000 miles. My pickup runs just as good now as when I first fired it up after rebuilding the engine. I won't use anything else.","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2023",,

Great for older engines.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Papaw,"This is great oil for older flat tappet engines. Read a lot about this hurting catalytic converters, but if your engine doesn't burn oil you don't have any worries! Use this in my 1997 Jeep Cherokee and my 2000 Dodge 3500 Ram van.","Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2023",,
"Hands down, best oil for air cooled VWs",5.0 out of 5 stars,Simi Rambler,"I own 3 classic VW beetles, And for years I've tried to match the best oil for these engines. Tried everything, from dyno oils, synthetic blends to boutique full grade synthetics. I was never satisfied until I found. Valvoline VR1 full synthetic high sync. CAUTION: Do not get confused with the silver and blue bottle labeled as VR1 Racing. It's not syntheti, get the black bottle.
The high zinc content is perfect for these and older engines with flat tapped cams. Add a can of Liquimoly Mos2, And your engine will absolutely love it. Easy vold starts, top protectoon during extreme heat, and a smooth running engine until the next oil change at 3K miles. Follow this simple rule And you will have an engine for life.","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2023",,

Great Dino oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Evolution,"After tons of research and a long journey down the rabbi hole of oil. I stumbled on this high zinc racing oil for air cooled motors specifically.

"Good product, good price",5.0 out of 5 stars,Drewscapes,"Quality oil. Delivered undamaged!!
Good price.
Ordered from wallimart and all grease tubes were literally crushed and oil was leaking out of box. Many leaking quarts of synthetic oil!
It was clear that the damage happened at the distribution center but these days quality control has been awful amongst SOME companies.
TO SUM UPâ€¦Stay with companies like this. The quality control and packaging is great.","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2023",,
