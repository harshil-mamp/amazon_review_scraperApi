"Quality oil, meets manufacturer specs for BMW R1250 GS Adventure",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cletus Van Damme,"This oil feels good. I did the running in service myself at 700 miles on my 2022 BMW R1250 GS Adventure and used this oil at 5w40. It meets all specifications called for in the BMW manual since it's API-SL and JASO MA-2 rated. I just changed the oil again at 3,800 miles and it was a dark honey color, but not black. It could have easily gone another couple thousand miles (as is the recommended interval) but I did about 1000 miles of dirt and wanted to go ahead and change it early. Engine and clutch feel fine with this oil. I'm going to keep using it. Definitely best to get it by the case on Amazon. The GS takes almost 4 full quarts, so 2 cases would give you 3 oil changes with a bit of extra just in case. This brings the cost of GS oil changes down to around $60 if you include the cost of the filters and new crush washers. Not too bad and definitely better than the dealer.","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2023",,
Like so much I now have on my Subscribe list,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mark Lubbock,"I change my oil every 3-4k miles & have been using this Castrol each time. I ride in extreme heat, and often in stop/go traffic where ambient temps are 95-110 degrees. Watching oil pressure in all types of traffic this oil is performing as desired. To explore effectiveness, I look at the drain plug magnet for metal filings and find only occasional tiny specs. The oil color is never black, though at the time of change it is naturally dark.
I now have this on a six-week subscription order which coincides with my trips and time to change oil.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023",,
Very good oil but had to buy oil at Auto Zone,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jay Wyatt,The oil is very good oil however I never received it from Amazon. I live in New Orleans and it was delivered apparently and stolen off my porch. Finally got someone to help me today and gave me a full refund for I had already bought the same oil in question locally for my 4k mile trip. Amazon has great customer service and did not hesitate to deny my refund. Oil is great oil for whoever decides to buy same oil off Amazon. Thank you Amazon,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023",,
Quality oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Uncle Bob,Can’t get a better lubricant at this price for v- twin. You can use in gear box and primary but I only use in engine that I have invested a lot of time and money into.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2023",,
"Run this in my 2v and 4v Ducati's, no issues!",5.0 out of 5 stars,B.B.,"I do maintenance on both my Ducatis. I like this oil for both my air cooled, dry clutch 2v and water cooled, wet clutch 4v Duc motors.  It doesn't seem to burn off over a season of riding and stays pretty clean even in my wet clutch bike.  Catch it on-sale and it's the best priced, good quality full synthetic MC oil around IMO.","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023",,

Vespa power,5.0 out of 5 stars,Larry W.,"This is the recommended oil for Vespas. I used others. But this is a great price, a case for the price of 2 ltr when purchased separately. So now I have enough for a couple changes in both my scooters for the price I'd payed before for 1. Great deal unless they go up on the price.","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2023",,
