This seems to work great!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bill,"I always bought premix for my Stihl weedeater, blower and hedge trimmer but decided to save some money and mix my own gas w/oil.
Stabil has a good reputation as a gas additive to keep gas fresh.
The oil mix seems to allow my equipment to start easier, run smoother and quieter.","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023",,
Weed eater,5.0 out of 5 stars,Home DIYâ€™er,Easy to use with it designed for a gallon of fuel. Just dump it into the container and fill with gas. My weedeater seems to run as good or better than the last one oil I used. Nice product.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023",,

What's in this stuff? A miracle healing elixir,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doug K.,"My 4-year-old 2-cycle Hitachi leaf blower simply refused to start last week after winter storage.  I replaced the spark plug, air filter, used fresh gas, - you name it and I tried it. Thought my arm was going to fall off after repeated fruitless pulling.
As a last ditch effort I decided to switch brands of 2-cycle oil. Bought the Sta-Bil 2-cycle oil twelve pack of mini-bottles. It was the most economical (per ounce) way to buy and I could use it in my 2-cycle weed whacker too.
Poured a full mini-bottle of Sta-Bil oil into my one-gallon gas can, added fresh gas from my bigger 5-gallon gas can, gave the smaller can a quick shake to ensure everything was mixed, and poured this into the old Hitachi. Pumped the flex ball to push gas thru the carburetor and I walked away. After 45 minutes I returned, pumped the flex ball again to be sure things were primed, said a quick prayer, and pulled the cord.
After the third pull I heard a pop, adjusted the carburetor choke, and on the next pull the engine started up. It's been starting on the second pull ever since.  Did the Sta-Bil oil make the difference? Who knows...
But before you toss out your 2-cycle small engine - give this oil a try. Sure glad I did.","Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2023",,
Less to worry about,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jon,I used it in my chainsaw gas mix for a few tanks. chainsaw still working with no issues. Left the mixed fuel to sit for 6 months and chainsaw started with no issues. It is a good price and a huge convinience that it does actually function as a fuel stabilizer.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2023",,
