Liquid Engineering,5.0 out of 5 stars,Duke,I discovered Liqui Moly engine oil about 4 years ago and now I won't use anything else.  They've expanded their product line quite a bit since then and I've tried a few of their other products.  Stick with the quality brands and you won't regret it.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023",,

"Best oil, if you’re precious about your engine",5.0 out of 5 stars,MrGraingerPA,"I started using Liqui Moly in my Mini Cooper S  a few years ago and change it every year (around 3,000 miles). I’ve always used good quality oil in my cars but this is hands down the best for retaining viscosity. My engine runs quieter and burns through a lot less oil. I can see the difference when I drain it after a year and it still feels fresh. Mini Coopers, like other high power small turbo engines, will burn through around a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or so, but not with Liqui Moly. For the sake of an extra $5-$10 it’s worth it","Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2022",,
Good oil.  Bad price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Michael,"The price is bad everywhere, not just on Amazon or something.  My only complaint is the price point.  Liqui Moly is a premium oil, so it has a higher price-point across the board.  My 2003 BMW 325xi with the M54 engine burns oil to begin with — it burned oil off the factory line — and i was told that at her age i should “”only”” use Liqui Moly.  It’s just another expense, especially since the liter containers aren’t sold in my local parts stores.  The chains, you know who i mean.  Good oil.  Bad price and, to a lesser extent, availability.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2021",,

Amazing!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,"As an automotive mechanic who specializes in diesel and German cars I am very picky about the products I use on my customer and personal vehicles. This is by far one of the best oils I have found to run in my 2011 mk6 vw golf 2.0 cjaa common rail diesel. Every oil analysis I have had done show my oil is still good at the 10,000 mile interval where my Castrol professional ll03 had lost many of its useful components at 7500-8500. The price point is also amazing plus it comes with a sticker on the bottle to make a reminder sticker for your window. With the level of customer service I have received when I was investigating the oil and the long service intervals and lower cost you can’t go wrong.","Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2020",,
