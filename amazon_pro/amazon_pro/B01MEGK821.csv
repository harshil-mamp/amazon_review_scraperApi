As Advertised,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hook'nBull,"I'm done buying manufacture's recommended same brand oil for small engines.  Oil is oil, and the Pennzoil looks no different than the recommended 10W30 Honda oil for their small generators that cost almost twice as much.  At the moment I'm using this in a new lawnmower engine and it's just as pure as any other conventional oil.  Will be buying Pennzoil from now on.","Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2023",,
