So far so good!! 2009 Chevy Suburban 2500 LT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,"So far so good! I have a 2009 Chevy Suburban 2500 LT with just a lil over 150K miles on the engine and decided to try the Valvoline High Mileage 150K Synthetic oil for my Florida Road Trip, starting from the North East Coast driving to the southwest coast of Florida.. I have to say right now this is hands down the best oil I have ever used for a high mileage engine. My Suburban has the common Chevy LS engine oil consumption problem and the agonizing Low Oil Pressure gauge reading. I also had a check engine light on that I had on for months. Before my trip I took my Surburban to my mechanic and instructed him to use this oil I purchased. Did the oil change and guess what.. After a few hundred miles of driving south towards my destination, the check engine light turned off and the oil pressure seems to be normal.  Drove about 1200 miles checked the oil and I was shocked.  Right now It looks to be working really well and not consuming oil the way it was before where I had to constantly monitor and add Valvoline Synthetic 5w30 oil. Will be using this from now on with 3K oil Change intervals…","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023",,B00AM1Z67O,https://api.scraperapi.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00AM1Z67O%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1%3FpageNumber%3D1&api_key=b90c4dcc61e317892bb64c328c931de7&scraper_sdk=python

Best oil to date for high mileage Yukon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jeff,"In a high-mileage Yukon I was having trouble with both burning and leaking full-synthetic oil.

Lubes up the car parts,5.0 out of 5 stars,Matt C.,"I'm not a mechanic, but this oil seems to be a great value for the money. You can save a ton of money by doing your oil changes yourself.

Buy when price is right!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bhatta's Reviews,"I am not an expert but I do try my best to maintain my own cars at home. When it comes to replacing engine oil requirements for my FORD vehicles, I used to always buy Genuine Motorcraft Ford Fluid SAE 5W-20 Premium Synthetic Blend Motor Oil, Amazon used to have great pricing on Motorcraft SAE 5W-20 Premium Synthetic Blend almost beating Walmart pricing but off lately that oil has become very expensive and mostly unavailable.
I took a chance and got this Valvoline SAE 5W-20 Synthetic Blend product and since all my FORD cars are old > 75,000 miles or more this High Mileage with MaxLife Technology blend fits the requirements perfectly. I am all for not going to local auto parts store whenever possible as you tend to pickup additional items that you do not need and sits in the garage for years without getting used. If you are a prime member you might find this less expensive at times, fast delivery thus saves time as the product gets delivered to your door.

Great oil for old cars,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kevin,"I've recently been learning about cars and overall maintenance. For a vehicle at 230k miles I've started changing oil every 5k. The first time I used a different oil. The last two times I've used this oil. The first oil changed was horrible. Sludge no less. The second oil changebetter, but pretty much black. The last oil change, which was this oil, not as black and a slight burnt smell. My car was also burning some oil. I think in my case just a combo of an old engine,old coolant which I plan on flushing and old PVC valve which I just changed out with a new one. But honestly I think the burning helped get rid of some carbon. So at 240k and about 2-3 oil changes with this oil, my vehicle runs so much smoother. Truly appreciate this brand.

Piece-of-mind lubrication in your pavement pounder!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wizbang72,"I've had a LOT of beaters over the years.  This has been the first task on all of them the day they first hit my garage:  Valvoline High Mileage Synthetic Blend with Lucas Oil Stabilizer and a Fram Tough Guard filter.  Of all the beaters I've had, none died from an oil related failure.  I have also found over the years some cheaper/generic oils in a burner/leaker tends to burn/leak worse.  Perfect middle-of-the line price point for piece-of-mind lubrication in your pavement pounder!  I have put 200k+ on Mopar v8's to Ford 4 cylinders.  My personal record was 344k on a Mopar 3.0 v6 Dodge Grand Caravan - she went to the bone yard due to excessive and flat out dangerous frame rot, and was driven there under her own power.  Was it the oil?  Maybe.  More likely religious 3k oil changes.  None the less with 35yrs under the hood, I trust Valvoline and will continue to use it.
***UPDATE 5.24.2021***  I retract nothing from the above, as I do still think Valvoline is a quality product.  However, I have come to recognize there are indeed even BETTER options out there.  I have become an AMSOIL convert, and a 100% believer in the hype.  New vehicles/small engines and rotten old beaters alike in my fleet now receive it.  I won't bash Valvoline - it is what I believe to be the highest quality you can buy in that price range.  None the less, I have upgraded and moved on.....","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2020",,B00AM1Z67O,https://api.scraperapi.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00AM1Z67O%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_9%3FpageNumber%3D9%26filterByStar%3Dfive_star&api_key=b90c4dcc61e317892bb64c328c931de7&scraper_sdk=python

I have not noticed any difference in mileage while using synthetic vs conventional oils; which I have used for decades. Supposedly synthetic is the way to go especially using the correct viscosity of course. Lengthening the oil change intervals is recommended with synthetic-7500 to 15000 miles.

Best oil in my book,4.0 out of 5 stars,Phil,"I have been doing my own oil changes for years. I have an 2005 Chevy Malibu, with 220K miles on it and still going strong. I've bounced around different oils, generally just using whatever was the most cost effective at the time, with no real concern for brand. However recently I've noticed a serious difference between this and those other conventional oils that I was using. It started with a rough idle that was primarily caused by a ignition coil pack, however after repairing that I noticed the issue, although lessened drastically, was still there a bit, I decided that although I was not quite to the 4K mileage mark, I needed to do an oil change. Oil change done, and the rough idle has gone away. Coincidence? I don't believe so.
Regardless, I am very impressed with this product so far. I also note as others have done, the price on amazon tends to fluctuate, it will go up to around $30 for awhile, then drop to around $18. With prime shipping that is a very good deal. When the price goes higher, I price shop around. Today I found it at Wal-mart locally for $17.74+tax. I bought two just in case. Like others on here, I would recommend putting this on your wish list and waiting for it to drop again, when it does stock up.","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2016",,B00AM1Z67O,https://api.scraperapi.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00AM1Z67O%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2%3FpageNumber%3D2%26filterByStar%3Dfour_star&api_key=b90c4dcc61e317892bb64c328c931de7&scraper_sdk=python

I certainly didn't want to use a lower grade and yet I was not even finding the heavier 20/50 either. So like so many other items I checked on line and decided to purchase from Amazon.
Not interested in wasting time and fuel to run around tying to locate something when I need it now.
As to the oil, it seems to work well in my old 91 Chevy truck with a 5.7. with some minor engine mods.
I will and have recommend this oil.
11/07/18 - I still use this oil in my older truck, still no issues. Also buying again from Amazon, I still have issues finding this weight 10/40 or the 20/50 in the local stores anymore, this included the auto stores, Walmart and several others.
