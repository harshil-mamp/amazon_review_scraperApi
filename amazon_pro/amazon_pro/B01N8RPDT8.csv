OEM Oil. Can't be beaten,5.0 out of 5 stars,Homer van Meter,"First of all, if you need this oil, you know it. You have a Super Duty or other Diesel Truck that recommends 10W30. I am sure there are other oils out on the market that are great, maybe even ""superior"" if you are going to go past 5K or so between changes. I would NOT buy a cheap, no-name oil, even if it meets specs as you do not know much about the company or additive packages. Face it: You pay 70K and up for one of these rigs and you are going to go cheap on oil?
Ford has designed this oil for Super Duty trucks and, while, quite frankly, were I a GM or Ram guy, I most likely would use their oil, Motorcraft is an excellent oil for them. Shell Rotella is another excellent choice, but I chose to stick OEM. It is a very good product, fairly priced and the 5 QT jugs are easy to use.
