Reconsider ordering this with breakable items.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Turbobuick,"Yup, it's motor oil! Exactly as pictured.  Six bottles sealed in a cardboard carton.  I ordered this with some other items and they they all arrived in the same big cardboard box.  The other items were a small book, and an electronic children's toy. It's a testament to UPS that this heavy, solid box didn't crush everything else, as the fistful of plastic air bags wouldn't have kept it from sliding around.  Reconsider purchasing this on an order that contains fragile items.
A full six quarts, unlike the 5 quart bottle. Many cars take more than the old standby ""four quarts plus whatever fits in the filter.""
If you search a car enthusiast forum for ""What brand of oil should I use?"" you'll find a thousand pages of opinions and horror stories.  Opinions are mixed on every brand, including Mobil 1, but many high-end and high-performance manufacturers specify it (some exclusively) for their cars. If these companies that spend billions on research require it in their super cars, I suspect it'll be just fine for the 21-year-old Mercedes wagon I use to haul the dog around.  Bottom line: fresh oil of the correct viscosity is always better than dirty oil that's been in there too long.  Change your oil!","Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2015",,
A Steal of a Deal when Amazon has it on Sale,4.0 out of 5 stars,texan_176@yahoo.com,"This oil is a great value when it goes on sale periodically on Amazon.  About $26 shipped to your door for a case of 6 quarts is a steal.  The oil itself is good but not great.  Most modern cars can last 300K+ miles with regular oil changes and taking it easy when driving.  I have been using synthetic oil in all of my cars for nearly 20 years (as long as I have been driving) and found this to be a better oil meaning it does not ""cook"" inside the engine and come out as a coal black liquid or worse; as a semisolid sludge.  Only Castrol Syntec has worked better in my cars by leaving the engine as a somewhat honey colored oil that has resisted cooking and causing problems with deposits on internal parts.  You can read up on scientific studies and lab control conditions to test Mobile 1 and competitors but this unscientific result I see has served me well.
Moblie 1 at $26 for 6 quarts is worth buying.  If it is closer to $50 for the case you can buy the 5 quart jug of Castrol for around $25 and be better off.","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2016",,
My favorite brand of oil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Frank,"My favorite brand of oil although I can scientifically say why other than I’ve had probably 20 cars and countless small engines running this stuff and never had any of them go boom. That’s enough for me to say I trust the oil even though I’m sure there’s many other lines of oil that likely come from the same place with a different label and do the same thing.
I don’t care about gas mileage, horsepower or other metrics other than the components are protected and don’t fail.
I use Mobil1 in every scenario oil will help. Engines, guns and may other things that can use lubrication. I’d buy other ‘premium’ oils if I had to but why? It’s oil. It works","Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2020",,
I don't know any better oil.,5.0 out of 5 stars,syngeskal,"This is definitely a great engine oil with excellent lubrication ability. While I don't drive much in terms of mileage per year, when I drive I drive for many hours at a time due to many camping trips throughout the USA. Once in the heat of the California inland desert, temperatures were hitting 120 degrees at noon and I was stuck in traffic for a long period, followed by another five hours of drive. This oil really performs well and the engine in my six cylinder auto still performs almost like new after many years on the road. Engine oils are definitely different from brand to brand and some are clearly better than others. Mobil 1 is an excellent choice for me - I have tried others, but I came back to this oil due to excellent performance. Yes, it costs more but the difference is worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2016",,
Long time user ... .very happy,5.0 out of 5 stars,HClarkx,"I've been using Mobil 1 pretty much since it hit the streets.  I still try to change the oil in my cars according to the manufacturer's time and mileage requirements listed in the car manual but I don't worry if I go over by a month or 1000 miles if it's not convenient to change it on schedule.  Plenty of tests have shown this oil to hold up well.  I'm most likely to go over the recommendations if a lot of highway driving is involved.  I've put 100K miles on a couple of cars and they were still not using oil, being down only maybe 1/2 quart at 5000 miles.  Good enough for me.  Amazon's price is the same as Sam's Club but Amazon delivers to my door via Prime.
Amazon only carries Bosch Premium filters for my cars.  I wish they would carry the standard Bosch filters which I feel are adequate since I change the filter with every oil change.  They are available at RockAuto.","Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2014",,
