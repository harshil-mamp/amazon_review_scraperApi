This may be the very best synthetic oil made.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Randyman,"I have run synthetic since they first started making it waaay back in the early days when Zenex hit the shelves over 40 years ago. Bet you never heard of that. We ran it in our race cars and street machines and saw significant frictional losses and increases in horsepower and mileage. I have studied and played with countless brands since then. Out of all of them, Royal Purple does everything you expect and more. They don't cut corners anywhere. It is now the oil and formula that I use to measure all the rest by.","Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2023",,

The Purple,5.0 out of 5 stars,M. Wilson,"Best oil out there!  Want better gas mileage and higher performance?  Use Royal Purple and see for yourself. I use the 5w20 in a 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 with the 5.7 HEMI. It cost more because your getting more in every quart.  Try it and like me you won't use any thing else in your car or truck.

Best daily driver oil on the market,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shane,What else can I say? This is the best oil on the market for your road vehicles.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2023",,
Actually improved MPG...slightly.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kevin Adams,"My car averaged 19.5 MPG for the first 18 months of ownership, using name brand synthetic oil. Shortly after changing to this oil, that went to 19.7 and 3 months later raised to 19.9. Nothing else had changed- same daily trips to work and back as always- so I think the oil did it. Still only about 7 ""extra"" miles per week, but in a year's time it's like a free tankful of fuel. So this oil more than pays for itself compared to the top quality oils I had used previously.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2022",,
