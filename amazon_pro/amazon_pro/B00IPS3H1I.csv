Quality Engine in the Correct weight for the engine,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dickensian,"My car is an older car with 100,000 miles. The engine of my car was built for 10/40 oil which is no longer carried in filling stations. Dont let mechanics and the oil changing stations tell you that 15/30 or any other weight oil will be OK. It's not true. Buy 10/40 and take it you when changing the oil","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",,
