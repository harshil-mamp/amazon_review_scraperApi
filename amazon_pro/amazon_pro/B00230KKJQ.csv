A Fine American üá∫üá∏ Product!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bill B.-AZ,"After 30 years of working in the Powersports business, I‚Äôm very familiar with the name ‚ÄúPJ1,‚Äù but, for some reason, I‚Äôve never used any of their products before now. Looking for a good quality chain lube for my newly-purchased chain-drive m-cycle, I purchased a can of PJ-1s ‚ÄúBlue Label‚Äù chain lube. I liked everything they advertised about it. Imagine my surprise when, once the product arrived, the spray can wouldn‚Äôt spray, only ‚Äúdribble.‚Äù Since this product didn‚Äôt come from Amazon, they suggested I call PJ-1 directly for replacement. The phone number‚Äôs on the can. When I did, ‚ÄúRyan‚Äù in ‚ÄúTech Support‚Äù listened to my complaint, verified that I was following proper use instructions and then promptly shipped me a brand new replacement can of PJ1 Blue Label Chain Lube at NO CHARGE! Who does THAT anymoreüò≥? Once the can arrived, I promptly put it to use. It works really well! The lube comes out almost clear & sticks well to the chain. The small amount of overspray I got on the rear wheel of my m-cycle wiped-off easily. What‚Äôs more, after a 200-mile ride with the PJ1 on my chain, the one ‚Äútight spot‚Äù I had in the chain seems to have ‚Äúloosened up,‚Äù as I can‚Äôt find a tight spot anywhere on my chain now. Damn, this stuff‚Äôs good!
Thank you, Amazon, for carrying PJ1 motorcycle chain lube. Thank you, Ryan, for the great Customer Service, and thank you PJ1 for making a fine American üá∫üá∏ product. I‚Äôll use PJ1 chain lube now as long as I‚Äôm riding motorcycles with chain drive!","Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71I6VfVD+3L._SY88.jpg,
"Switched from gear oil to PJ1 Blue, clean is the way to go!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tony Ferrante,"So I‚Äôm old school. I run the original 525 O-Ring chain on my DR650. O-Ring chains are permanently lubricated internally so all you really need to do is protect the chain from rusting and provide a light lube to the O-Ring (but use a lubricant that won‚Äôt infiltrate and weaken the permanent grease); gear oil works great for this but it‚Äôs really messy, dirt cakes on and clings! I‚Äôve been lubricating with gear oil for about 4 decades because I‚Äôm a fast learner.  Just tried PJ1 Blue and Wow what a difference! Dirt doesn‚Äôt stick to it and if it gets dirty just hose it off.  Last about 500 miles, easy to reapply, and everything stays CLEAN!  I did a section of WABDR, got home and sprayed the bike down with the garden hose, my chain & countershaft sprocket look that good!","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2023",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Mj7dJ8ILL._SY88.jpg,
It puts the lube on the chain and then gets the hose again,5.0 out of 5 stars,MuffincCow,this product does what it is supposed to and does it well in my opinion.  Any lube is better than no lube... that's what she said!!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023",,
Does the job,4.0 out of 5 stars,Zachary Durocher,"Does the job, not the best brand, but it works in a pinch, id get it again but it doesnt come with any other items like a brush or rag.","Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2023",,
Excellent Chain Lube Goes In Thin then Gets NIcely thick and stays put,5.0 out of 5 stars,George R. Edge,I have been using chain lube since the 60s at both my work and on my motorcycles and vehicles where it is used mainly for hinges (not really so great for locks as it gets pretty thick and sticky).  This is the best chain lube I have found for motorcycle use and for the chains used in industrial applications.  It goes on thin enough to reach into the rollers of an O-Ring type motorcycle chain and then it gets thicker and remains in place quite well.  It is good for door latches on vehicles and for hood latches and things like this as well.  A little can go a long ways and although I buy this in rather small cans it will usually last me 3+ years of use and yet I service quite a few vehicles per year and so it is efficient and doesn't take up much space among my supplies and chemicals when I do mobile repairs.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2022",,

"Awesome lube for your motorcycle chain, but make sure there's a cap on it!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jason E.,"I always love this lubricant for my motorcycle chain. This is probably my go to lube from now until the end of time. One thing that bothered me was when I had received my package. The cap for the chain lube was completely missing. Not only that, but it looked like the lube sprayed a little on the box upon receiving it. Its definitely not the carrier's fault as he's just trying to get it from point A to point B. However, whoever processed or fulfilled it probably thought saw that the cap was missing or it popped off and figured it should be safe to transport anyway with a couple of airbags in there. Well guess what? There is a reason aerosol cans have caps so the nozzle doesn't get sprayed. In this case, it did get sprayed and although it wasn't a lot to have lube drip from the amazon box, it was enough for a strong smell when opening a package along with residue in the box. I usually don't mind these things, but how hard is it to just put a cap on this thing and ship it off? What if this can was upside down and all of a sudden the nozzle gets pressed until the can is empty? Its the small things that can turn into a big issue. Luckily that wasn't that case and I've only lost a small amount for something that I bought that was supposed to be brand new.","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2017",,
My new favorite,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mark K,"I was using gear oil as chain lube. Gear oil attracts more dirt and slings on to swing arm. PJ1 doesn't seem to allow the chain to move as freely initially.  But at the end of the day there's less dirt so I feel like the chain is overall being protected from the abrasion caused by dirt.
PJ1 is also easier to clean off but gear oil wasn't either if you cleaned regularly.","Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2022",,

I like this stuff!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Computerboy,"2007 Honda CB900F 919 Hornet  Hadn‚Äôt lubed a chain in about twenty years so the guy at the local parts department suggested this stuff (probably since it‚Äôs all they carried!). I put it on after I‚Äôve come back from riding (supposedly the chain is ‚Äúhot‚Äù). they tell you on their web site how to do it, but I put the bike up on my Pit Bull stand and turn the wheel while spraying it on the chain kinda edgewise (not on the flat outer or inner edges) on the outside links, and then the same thing on the inside set of links until I get it on all around. This way it also gets a chance to ‚Äúdry‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt get thrown off the chain. Actually, I get more on the wheel putting it on, and really haven‚Äôt seen any thrown off. I shake the can well before application and the valve is good enough that you can control the amount of the spray that comes out. I do it once in a while, maybe a couple or three weeks apart. My chain was rusty when I got the bike, now it looks well lubricated. I also try to keep the chain adjusted correctly. This ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù is for the o-ring chains. If you go to the PJ1 site it tells you all about the stuff. It comes in an 8 oz and 13 oz can.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2012",,
